Earlier in the year, ITV viewers voted for their favourite Corrie moment from 50 nominations brought together by a distinguished panel of Corrie experts, including the show's creator Tony Warren and original cast member William Roache, and the results will be revealed over the course of the show. Classic moments will be relived through a mix of archive clips and revealing interviews with the stars, writers, producers and directors who helped bring them to the screen. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979ae282174d777eb0960bfb81bea690aefd117f","amp;dn":"Coronation+Street%3A+50+Years%2C+50+Moments+-+Part+Two+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979ae282174d777eb0960bfb81bea690aefd117f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,154,226,130,23,77,119,126,176,150,11,251,129,190,166,144,174,253,17,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
