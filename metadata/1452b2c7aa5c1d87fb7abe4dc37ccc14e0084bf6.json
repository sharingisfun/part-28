This is my kind of horror film. There are lots of suspenseful moments, interspersed with pockets of tongue in cheek humor that made me laugh out loud! Oh, and a love story to boot! and great music! This movie was extremely entertaining while in the theater, and very thought provoking on the ride home. The other three people in my car and I had a lively discussion after the movie. I loved the movie as I watched it and then still loved it as it opened up so much discussion! The characters were all well developed, and yet each one had a bit of non-formulaic mystery and intrigue that made each of us in the car get attached to a different one. And we kept quoting lines from the movie for weeks afterward. Now that's a good movie!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1452b2c7aa5c1d87fb7abe4dc37ccc14e0084bf6","amp;dn":"Growing+Out++2009+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1452b2c7aa5c1d87fb7abe4dc37ccc14e0084bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,82,178,199,170,92,29,135,251,122,190,77,195,124,204,20,224,8,75,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
