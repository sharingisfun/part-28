This album was recorded live at Blues Alley, Georgetown DC on July 30, 2001. There are many significant features about this CD; Rick goes into the audience and borrows a patron's champagne glass and uses it as a slide on the guitar. Joey plays the organ, bass lines, and trumpet all at the same time. Bertell Knox plays incredible percussion at the age of 74. This album was mixed and produced at Racetrack Sound Studios' Les Paul Control Room by Paul Chiacchierini and Rick Wurzbacher. Mastering was completed at John Oram's Analogue Barn in Meopham, Kent, England, by John Oram 'The Father of British EQ', assisted by Dave Cherry and Ash Phipps using the patented British Analogue Mastering technique with Maximum Saturation Technology.\n\n--------\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows).
