A recent study published by the Mayo Clinic Proceedings shows health benefits outweigh the risks of infant circumcision. The WHO found male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually transmitted HIV infections by 60 per cent, encouraging countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi and South Africa to implement national circumcision programmes. \n\nAs part of its effort to combat AIDS, Zimbabwe aims to circumcise more than one million men by 2015. To support the campaign, a group of legislators underwent circumcision in 2012. \n\nNumerous advertisement campaigns around Africa extol the benefits of circumcision. \nRoughly 1.1 million people in Zimbabwe live with HIV. Studies show circumcision could reduce the risk of infection by 60 per cent. Since 2011, Zimbabwean men and infants have been undergoing voluntary non-surgical circumcision. Opponents of circumcision argue the risks donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t outweigh the benefits and claim messaging is giving men a false sense of hope regarding HIV prevention.
