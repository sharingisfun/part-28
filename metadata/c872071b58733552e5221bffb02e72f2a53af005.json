At first, Setzer played rockabilly covers in a band called the Tom Cats with his brother, drummer Gary, and bassist Bob Beecher; however, Setzer soon abandoned that group to join up with newly rechristened school friends Lee Rocker (born Leon Drucker) and Slim Jim Phantom (born James McDonnell). However, their retro '50s look and sound didn't go over well around Long Island, and in the summer of 1980, the group headed to England, where a rockabilly revival movement was just beginning to emerge. \n\n\nGenre................: Rockabilly Revival\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: EMI\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Cue, Log\n\n\n01.Rock This Town\n02.Fishnet Stockings\n03.Built For Speed\n04.Rev It Up &amp; Go\n05.Stray Cat Strut\n06.Rumble In Brighton\n07.My One Desire\n08.Runaway Boys\n09.You Can't Hurry Love\n10.Baby Blue Eyes\n11.Lonely Summer Nights\n12.Cruisin'\n13.18 Miles From Memphis\n14.Something's Wrong With My Radio\n15.I Won't Stand In Your Way\n16.Lucky Charm\n17.(She's) Sexy + 17\n18.Lookin' Better Every Beer\n19.Race With The Devil\n20.I Fought The Law\n21.Blast Off\n22.Bring It Back Again\n23.Gene And Eddie\n24.Give It To Me\n25.Elvis On Velvet\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c872071b58733552e5221bffb02e72f2a53af005","amp;dn":"Stray+Cats+Runaway+Boys+A+Retrospective+%2781+To+%2792+%281996%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c872071b58733552e5221bffb02e72f2a53af005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,114,7,27,88,115,53,82,229,34,27,255,176,46,114,242,165,58,240,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
