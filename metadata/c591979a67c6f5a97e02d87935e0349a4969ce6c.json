It's only a small file, please consider seeding it for a lot longer, thank you.\n\nLong out of print, copies today can still be bought but not cheaply (check out Amazon for instance). \nThis is one, if not the, first books about UFOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to discuss in some detail about crashed saucers and their retrieval.\nThis book, and the journalist author Scully, was Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdebunked &amp; discreditedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in TRUE magazine a couple of years after its publication by another journalist, J. P. Cahn, who ran a so-called exposÃƒÂ© on ScullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sources. \nSince then however, there has been a train of thought that the exposÃƒÂ© was possibly engineered by the US Military Establishment because Scully was getting being near to the truth about saucer retrieval.  \nWhatever oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinions are, this book is still an entertaining read about the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgolden ageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of UFOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from ArnoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1947 sighting to the early 1950Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s when the USAF were literally floundering in what response to give to the publicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..something that some believe is still the case today.\n\nI downloaded this as a word document from the internet and cleaned up, I hope, the spelling, grammar and formatting to make it as good as the original book was, and then converted it using Calibre into epub and PDF formats.\nPlease seed.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Scully&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Scully&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c591979a67c6f5a97e02d87935e0349a4969ce6c","amp;dn":"Re-upload+-+Rare+UFO+book.+Frank+Scully+-+Behind+the+Flying+Sauc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c591979a67c6f5a97e02d87935e0349a4969ce6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,145,151,154,103,198,245,169,126,2,216,121,53,224,52,154,73,105,206,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
