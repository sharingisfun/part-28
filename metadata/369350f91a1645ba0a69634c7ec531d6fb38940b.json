National Geographic opens an ancient case of missing persons, trying to determine the origins of a group of enigmatic mummies found in western China. What they find out may change what we know about the world. \n\nThe four individuals were part of a vanished world that existed in western China between 2600 and 4000 years ago - long before Marco Polo or the Silk Road. Yet these long-buried corpses look like Europeans and were found with tools that didn&amp;#039;t exist yet in that part of the world.\n\nWho were they? Where did they come from? And how might they have affected the spread of culture and technology in prehistoric times? Spencer Wells -- a National Geographic Explorer-in- Residence -- picks up the ongoing research on the mummies found in Chinas Tarim Basin. Only now, thanks to the latest advanced DNA technology and the exclusive Genographic database, new answers are starting to come in. and along the way a better understanding of the history that bound East and West.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 2058 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x432\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.593:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 47:29.320\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 745MB\nSubtitles: No subs\nRipped by: jvt40\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Riddle of the Desert Mummies\n* Mysterious Hanging Coffins of China\n\n2) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=China%27s_Mystery_Mummies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:369350f91a1645ba0a69634c7ec531d6fb38940b","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.China%5C%27s.Mystery.Mummies.DVB.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"369350f91a1645ba0a69634c7ec531d6fb38940b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,147,80,249,26,22,69,186,10,105,99,76,126,197,49,214,251,56,148,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
