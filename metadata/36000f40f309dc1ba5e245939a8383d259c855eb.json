Recorded at his home studio after the completion of the last Queen album, Made in Heaven, the album was released in the UK on 1 June 1998 and on 15 September of that year in the US. The album itself started life out as a cover album. The &quot;Heroes&quot; concept was to record his favourite tracks from his favourite artists, but the idea soon mutated into a full album. Some of the covers found their place on the album, whilst others were released as B-sides to singles and on the Another World tour promo CD.\n\nDrummer Cozy Powell died in a car accident before the album was completed.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written and composed by Brian May, except where noted.\n\n    &quot;Space&quot; - 0:47\n    &quot;Business&quot; - 5:07\n    &quot;China Belle&quot; - 4:01\n    &quot;Why Don't We Try Again&quot; - 5:24\n    &quot;On My Way Up&quot; - 2:57\n    &quot;Cyborg&quot; - 3:54\n    &quot;The Guv'nor&quot; - 4:13\n    &quot;Wilderness&quot; - 4:52\n    &quot;Slow Down&quot; (Larry Williams) - 4:18\n    &quot;One Rainy Wish&quot; (Jimi Hendrix) - 4:05\n    &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot; (Ian Hunter) - 5:16\n    &quot;Another World&quot; - 7:30 \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Brian May - all vocals, instruments and programming, except for:\n    Cozy Powell - drums on &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;China Belle&quot;, &quot;The Guv'nor&quot;, &quot;Slow Down&quot;, &quot;One Rainy Wish&quot;, and &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;, drums and percussion on &quot;Why Don't We Try Again?&quot;\n    Steve Ferrone - drums on &quot;Another World&quot;\n    Neil Murray - bass guitar on &quot;China Belle&quot;, &quot;Slow Down&quot;, &quot;One Rainy Wish&quot;, and &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;\n    Ken Taylor - bass guitar on &quot;Another World&quot;\n    Jamie Moses - guitar on &quot;Slow Down&quot;\n    Spike Edney - keyboards on &quot;Slow Down&quot;\n    London Metropolitan Orchestra - strings on &quot;One Rainy Wish&quot;, conducted by Michael Kamen\n    Cathy Porter - backing vocals on &quot;On My Way Up&quot;\n    Shelley Preston - backing vocals on &quot;On My Way Up&quot; and &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;\n    Nikki Love - backing vocals on &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;\n    Becci Glover - backing vocals on &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;\n    Taylor Hawkins - drums on &quot;Cyborg&quot;\n    Jeff Beck - guitar on &quot;The Guv'nor&quot;\n    Ian Hunter - guest raconteur on &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36000f40f309dc1ba5e245939a8383d259c855eb","amp;dn":"Brian+May+-+Another+World+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36000f40f309dc1ba5e245939a8383d259c855eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,0,15,64,243,9,220,27,165,226,69,147,154,131,131,210,89,200,85,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
