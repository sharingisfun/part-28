Charlotte Banks (Aly Michalka) has what it takes to be a true rock star, and with the battle of the bands approaching she's determined to win. Her chief opponent in the upcoming competition is none other than her egotistical ex-boyfriend Ben (Scott Porter). Ben may be cocky, but there's no denying his charisma when he takes the stage. With a little help from new arrival Will Burton (Connell), Charlotte's band begins to develop a unique sound and starts writing some original songs. Meanwhile, as Will and singer/guitarist Sa5m (Hudgeons) start to make a love connection, disaster strikes, and the band is forced to choose between conceding the competition or standing tall and finally living up to their true potential.\n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 51 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b646c2ac1d41e4baf1dbcdd7d2cc413048f78adf","amp;dn":"Bandslam%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK%28Smaller+file+size%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b646c2ac1d41e4baf1dbcdd7d2cc413048f78adf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,70,194,172,29,65,228,186,241,219,205,215,210,204,65,48,72,247,138,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
