However, the studio recuts the film, and when Smithee sees the results (which he describes as being &quot;worse than Showgirls&quot;) and realizes that he cannot use a pseudonym (because the only one allowed is &quot;Alan Smithee&quot;) he steals the film and goes on the run, threatening to burn it.\n\nCredits/Stats:\n\nDirected by:\tAlan Smithee (Arthur Hiller)\nProduced by\tBen Myron\n                Joe Eszterhas\nWritten by\tJoe Eszterhas\nStarring:\tRyan O'Neal\n                Coolio\n                Chuck D\n                Eric Idle\n                Richard Jeni\nMusic by \tChuck D\n                Gary G-Wiz\nCinematography\tReynaldo Villalobos\nEditing by\tL.
