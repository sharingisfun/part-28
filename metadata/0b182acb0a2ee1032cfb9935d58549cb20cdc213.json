It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager to the Mercury 7 astronauts, showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it. Thrilling, funny, charming and electrifying all at once.\n\nEnjoy\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b182acb0a2ee1032cfb9935d58549cb20cdc213","amp;dn":"Right.Stuff.1983.BRrip.AC3-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b182acb0a2ee1032cfb9935d58549cb20cdc213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,24,42,203,10,46,225,3,44,251,153,53,213,133,73,203,32,205,194,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
