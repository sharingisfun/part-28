It was described as a dark comedy from the pen of Simon Nye and was filmed on location in Cornwall. Set in the hamlet of St Gweep, Wild West observes the strange goings-on in the local Cornish community. Shop owners Mary Trewednack and her life-partner Angela are the main focus but there are many other characters in this sitcom.\n\nThe first series of the sitcom was scheduled to appear on prime-time BBC1 where its eccentricities met with a poor critical and popular response, but a second series was commissioned and both series have received retrospective praise.&quot;Wild West&quot; had some very black humour and dark characters, so was never meant to appeal to the masses - it's definitely one of those you either love or hate. \n\nMost of the sitcom was filmed in the village of Portloe in Cornwall.\n\nStars - Dawn French, Catherine Tate, Anne-Marie Duff, David Bradley, Sean Foley\n\nSeries 1  (6 x 30 minute episodes)\n\n  episode 1 - One Home Good, Two Homes Bad \n  episode 2 - Fear Of Bungee\n  episode 3 - Swingers\n  episode 4 - Tin, Tin, Tin\n  episode 5 - A Problem Shared Is A Problem Doubled\n  episode 6 - Un, Deu, Try, Figo, Quiggly\n\nSeries 2  (6 x 30 minute episodes)\n\n  episode 1 - The Exploding Car\n  episode 2 - Magical Horses\n  episode 3 - Angela Learns to Drive\n  episode 4 - Cornish Flu\n  episode 5 - The Film Crew\n  episode 6 - Holly Loses Faith in Witchcraft\n\nPlease seed back and share with others. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c60cf48c3f11c390afd47d4e4125031d77ea3187","amp;dn":"Wild+West+%282002+-+2004%29+complete+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c60cf48c3f11c390afd47d4e4125031d77ea3187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,12,244,140,63,17,195,144,175,212,125,78,65,37,3,29,119,234,49,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
