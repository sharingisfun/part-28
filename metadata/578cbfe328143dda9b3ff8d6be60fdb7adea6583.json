This remastering campaign has been praised and criticised in equal measure since the time of its release. Some people say they sound harsh and shrill, others that they sound clearer than other early (RCA) or late editions (Virgin remasters). You'll have to draw your own conclusions about the matter. For me, they sound all right and have some interesting bonus tracks added as well. All these titles have been long out of print. Lossless quality. Seed and enjoy.
