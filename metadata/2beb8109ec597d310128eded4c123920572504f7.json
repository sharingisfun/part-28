It was an attempt to summarize the new history of the DC Universe to establish what was canonical after Crisis reformed the multiverse into a single universe. In the original planning of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the History would have formed the final two issues, following the destruction of the Multiverse at the Beginning of Time, but this was changed, presumably because it would have been a very undramatic ending to the series.\n\nThe loose plotline of the series involves the character Harbinger chronicling the past, present, and future of the post-Crisis DC Universe. The history is mostly told through one- and two-page splash pages, accompanied by brief prose. At the end of the series, Harbinger places the history in a capsule and launches it into space. In the subsequent series Millennium, this history is intercepted by the Manhunters and used against Earth's superheroes.\n\nThe series was initially reprinted in hardcover by Graphitti Designs, and reprinted in paperback years later.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_DC_Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_DC_Universe&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2beb8109ec597d310128eded4c123920572504f7","amp;dn":"The+History+of+the+DC+Universe+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2beb8109ec597d310128eded4c123920572504f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,235,129,9,236,89,125,49,1,40,237,237,76,18,57,32,87,37,4,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
