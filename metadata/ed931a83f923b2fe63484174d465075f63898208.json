Over the course of five CDs, the producers of this box have included all of RSO studio recordings and the funky soul-blues of King's Polydor album, Burglar, which Eric Clapton fans covet so much because he was listed as a second guitarist. Burglar was produced by Mike Vernon (with Tom Dowd producing a track) and another studio band that included bassist Carl Radle. Several of the album's outtakes and a studio version of Jimmy Rogers' &quot;That's All Right&quot; see release here for the first time. The second disc kicks off with the live Larger Than Life album. What's remarkable is that instead of the fade out on &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman,&quot; the rest of the track and concert performance is provided as well. The other discs are all live. Sound quality ranges from very good to excellent; none of this stuff is bootleg material (it would be beneath Bear Family's exacting standards). The final cut on disc five is another previously hidden gem taken from a gig where Clapton sings &quot;Further on Up the Road.&quot;\n\nDisc 1\nTime: 82:57\n[/color]\n01. Pack It Up (4:10)\n02.
