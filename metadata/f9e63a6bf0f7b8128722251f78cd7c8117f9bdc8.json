She remembers meeting Dylan and how her heart beat when Dylan touched her face, but nothing else. When Kara is sent to Demitar, the evil ruler of Inbetween, the truth is revealed. She is DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guardian and neither of them are who they thought they were.\n\nSet in a darker version our own world, Morning Rising follows Kara as she tries to save Dylan from DemitarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clutches. She is given three days to find Dylan and get her out of In between before she belongs to Demitar forever. Memories must be regained and powers restored if they have a chance of escaping. Each memory and sighting of Dylan helps Kara remember the love they once shared. If only she can help Dylan remember before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e63a6bf0f7b8128722251f78cd7c8117f9bdc8","amp;dn":"FF+Samantha+Boyette+-+Morning+Rising","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e63a6bf0f7b8128722251f78cd7c8117f9bdc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,230,58,107,240,247,184,18,135,34,37,31,120,205,124,129,23,249,189,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
