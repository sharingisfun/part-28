She spent years cooking in some of New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best restaurants, but it took moving home in 2008 for her to rediscover the wealth and diversity of the Midwestern table, and to witness its reinvention.\nThe New Midwestern Table reveals all that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come to loveÃ¢â‚¬â€and learnÃ¢â‚¬â€about the foods of her native Midwest, through updated classic recipes and numerous encounters with spirited home cooks and some of the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most passionate food producers. With 150 color photographs capturing these fresh-from-the-land dishes and the striking beauty of the terrain, this cookbook will cause any home cook to fall in love with the captivating flavors of the American heartland.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\nDIPS, PARTY FOOD ^ PRINKS\nSOUP OR SALAD\nLAKE FISH\nCHICKEN SUPPER\nMEAT\nSIDES\nPOTATOES &amp; ONIONS\nPROJECTS\nSWEETS\nEARLY-DAY BAKING\nBRUNCH\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nINDEX ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80e168742ae4158cd738c1ca8d25e6521602ff49","amp;dn":"The+New+Midwestern+Table+-+200+Heartland+Recipes+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80e168742ae4158cd738c1ca8d25e6521602ff49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,225,104,116,42,228,21,140,215,56,193,202,141,37,230,82,22,2,255,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
