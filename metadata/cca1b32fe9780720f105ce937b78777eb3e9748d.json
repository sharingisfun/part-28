In full pursuit of the good lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€œ boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddiesÃ¢â‚¬â€œhe holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him . . . and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help. Despite himself, Travis canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, THE CHOICE ultimately confronts us with the most heartwrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nNicholas Charles Sparks (born December 31, 1965) is an American novelist, screenwriter and producer. He has published seventeen novels and a non-fiction book. Eight of his romantic-drama novels have been adapted to film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca1b32fe9780720f105ce937b78777eb3e9748d","amp;dn":"The+Choice%7CEPUB%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca1b32fe9780720f105ce937b78777eb3e9748d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,161,179,47,233,120,7,32,241,5,206,147,123,120,119,126,179,233,116,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
