With contributions by professionals from the pharmaceutical industry, this book begins with a review of current mass spectrometry techniques and applications, followed by discussions of various methods for using MS in drug metabolism studies and pharmacokinetics. Highlighting the critical importance of ADME studies for understanding how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body, the book s focuses on the use of LC/MS and MALDI-MS. This is a valuable reference for scientists in the pharmaceutical industry, medicine, academia, and even those working in homeland defense.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3650b1d44f9f4bb41675750cb1b0c11b59283a7e","amp;dn":"SHAREGO+EBOOK+Mass+Spectrometry+in+Drug+Metabolism+and+Pharmacok","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3650b1d44f9f4bb41675750cb1b0c11b59283a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,80,177,212,79,159,75,180,22,117,117,12,177,176,193,27,89,40,58,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
