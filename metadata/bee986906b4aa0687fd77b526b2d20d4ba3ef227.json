CpuIdle is even working even when you're actively using your computer!\n\nCpuIdle created the very idea of software CPU cooling: CpuIdle was the first power management and CPU cooling software providing online-cooling during normal PC activity. When you first start CpuIdle on your PC, you'll see and almost immediate temperature drop:\n\t\t\nTemperature curve after starting CpuIdle\n\nCpuIdle uses several mechanisms to keep your CPU cool:\n\n    * shutdown CPU when not used (online cooling)\n    * optimize CPU for maximum cooling effect\n    * optimize chipset for maximum cooling effect (supported chipsets only)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bee986906b4aa0687fd77b526b2d20d4ba3ef227","amp;dn":"CpuIdle+Extreme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bee986906b4aa0687fd77b526b2d20d4ba3ef227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,233,134,144,107,74,160,104,127,215,123,82,107,45,32,212,186,62,242,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
