It is produced by the BBC with co-production from Discovery and BBC Worldwide. It describes the human species and its relationship with the natural world by showing the remarkable ways humans have adapted to life in every environment on Earth.\n\nAnnounced in 2007, the production teams based at the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol and BBC Wales spent three years shooting over 70 stories in some of the most remote locations on Earth spanning about 40 countries. Each episode of the series focuses on a different human-inhabited environment, including deserts, jungles, the Arctic, grasslands, rivers, mountains, oceans, and the urban landscape.\n\nThe series is narrated by John Hurt and features original music by composer Nitin Sawnhey.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://o.scdn.co/300/8c6c6267a699eeef2b4905c96cae0085aaf33408&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://o.scdn.co/300/8c6c6267a699eeef2b4905c96cae0085aaf33408&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01 - Title               0:49\t\n\n02 - Intro Montage       0:36\n\n03 - Shallow Sears       1:16\t\n\n04 - Asian Elephants     1:47\t\n\n05 - Bicycle Part 1      0:52\t\n\n06 - Bicycle Part 2      1:19\t\n\n07 - Reindeer Intro      2:47\t\n\n08 - Narwhal Intro       2:25\t\n\n09 - Creating An Igloo   1:11\t\n\n10 - The Rains           1:28\n\n11 - Ancient Cities      1:19\t\n\n12 - Rivers Intro        1:00\t\n\n13 - Bishnoi             1:29\n\n14 - Big Wave            1:01\n\n15 - Jungles End         1:15\t\n\n16 - Pet Keepers         3:14\t\n\n17 - Elephant Futures    0:57\t\n\n18 - Rivers Credit       0:33\t\n\n19 - Deserts At Night    0:35\t\n\n20 - The Sahara          2:47\t\n\n21 - Himalayas           2:19\t\n\n22 - Watching The Tides  0:49\t\n\n23 - Tree House          1:52\t\n\n24 - ------------        X:XX\n\n25 - Foods               1:06\t\n\n26 - Wild Horses Part 1  1:07\t\n\n27 - Wild Horses Part 2  1:11\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea6fb08acce53c0641e3e841ee5ba9fecd9a53b","amp;dn":"BBC+Human+Planet+OST+-+Nitin+Sawhney+%5B320kbps+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea6fb08acce53c0641e3e841ee5ba9fecd9a53b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,166,251,8,172,206,83,192,100,30,62,132,30,229,186,159,236,217,165,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
