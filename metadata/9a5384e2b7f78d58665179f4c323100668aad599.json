I had the SYF hat on and was looking for some fans for the hot Tucson summer.  Got to talking with this one fella and the GD came up.  He said to me after hearing about LL that he had some tapes.  I asked him if he knew where they came from.  He said &quot;I cant tell ya man&quot;.  I thot he meant that he &quot; didnt know cant tell&quot; but out he walked with a lil treasure chest of some cassettes. The cases werent pretty but the tapes were high end pro tapes.  I asked him again where he got them and again he said &quot;I cant tell you&quot; but it seems your folks in the trading world might like them  Well, i got home and found too many treasure to note.  He told me they werent always on the best dubbing deck and some had been played and were at least 25 years old (some older) but he was sure that these versions were recorded by what he termed a &quot;dear old buddy&quot; and official channels and he had them for years and years and would like some of them to see the light of day.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a5384e2b7f78d58665179f4c323100668aad599","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Band+-+1987-08-30+-+Greek+Theatre+in+Berkely%2C+CA++S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a5384e2b7f78d58665179f4c323100668aad599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,83,132,226,183,247,141,88,102,81,121,244,195,35,16,6,104,170,213,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
