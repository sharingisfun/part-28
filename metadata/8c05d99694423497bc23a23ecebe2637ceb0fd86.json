One can easily picture a bunch of A&amp;R execs thoroughly enthused at the marketability of an MC who sports a yarmulke. However, his 2005 J-Dub Records release, Live At Stubbs, is anything but a gimmick. Propelled by his recent Jimmy Kimmel Live performance, the &quot;King Without A Crown&quot; video in heavy rotation on the MTV U network, and a confirmed slot at this year's Bonnaroo festival, Matisyahu is quickly making a name for himself in the music industry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c05d99694423497bc23a23ecebe2637ceb0fd86","amp;dn":"Matisyahu+-+Live+at+Stubbs+%28As+seen+on+Jimmy+Kimmel+Show%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c05d99694423497bc23a23ecebe2637ceb0fd86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,5,217,150,148,66,52,151,188,35,162,62,206,190,38,55,206,176,253,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
