You need this record.\n\n   &quot;To listen to Jakob is to journey through the harsh, beautiful, isolated\n   landscape of the Hawkes Bay, NZ, that is their home. Swelling but direct,\n   beautiful and uplifting yet intense and hard. Jeff Boyle (guitar), Maurice\n   Beckett (bass) and Jason Johnson (drums) got together in 1998, to realize a\n   musical vision they all shared. The result is nothing short of a beautiful\n   contradiction; Uplifting yet dark and intense, both sonically massive and\n   delicately complex. Jakob defy definition and while many influences come to\n   mind theirs is a unique sound. A sonic landscape. With three albums, Subsets\n   of Sets, Cale:Drew &amp; Solace under their belts, Jakob continue to explore new\n   musical horizons.&quot;\n\n- track list ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  1.
