All the work has  an emphasis on the strange, bizarre, and freak side of the spanish music. It has really been difficult to find as it all got lost in the shadows of freakness! It's been  hard work to find but it is finally here on the pirate bay. \n\nLastly, there are 11 cd's in this compilation. I really wish you enjoy this music folks!\n\nBest Regards, Trocadero \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d3cf2e9e8cf9a7761fd1f3f0f94220faba5d43","amp;dn":"Spanish+Bizarro+-+Compilation+2014+-+Todos+los+CD%27S+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d3cf2e9e8cf9a7761fd1f3f0f94220faba5d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,211,207,46,158,140,249,167,118,31,209,243,240,249,66,32,250,186,93,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
