You can however Mount it using Daemon Tools. When you go to mount it using Daemon Tools where it says &quot;all image types&quot; change that to all files because it is not recognized as an image but believe me Daemon tools will load it and it works well!\n\nYou can play multiplayer over a lan or even via you ip over the internet. You can update the game but if you update it you can only play with others that have updated it. Enable all emulation on Daemon tools also (I don't remember if you need to for sure) but I don't want assholes saying it don't work if its something so simple ;-)\n\nand the CD key is\n\nw9p3v-6kf7w-rh7fy-jw3vt-8kvxt\n\nAgain even if you have 20 machines and you all use this cd key it will still work as it does not cross check to see if you have a unique key.\n\nAnd Lastly....\n\nI have been downloading from the bay (I always seed 2.0 - 10.0 ratio) You may not know my name as this is my first upload but I can assure you I will only upload Great Content!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cded52561f6bb0eb88f156c0bc50c08adf650c97","amp;dn":"Rise+Of+Nations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cded52561f6bb0eb88f156c0bc50c08adf650c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,237,82,86,31,107,176,235,136,241,86,192,188,80,192,138,223,101,12,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
