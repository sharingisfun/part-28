There is turmoil in the 5th century Celtic periphery of Europe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an age of change at the end of the Roman Empire and an age of conflict between peoples and religions. Oppressed by Saxons to the east, many of the Celts of Britain have colonised Armorica in Gaul. Gwynlan, the last of the Druids, is caught in a mysterious battle for survival against the monks of the church. Accusations of depravity, murder, sacrifice and sorcery are rife, but the old gods are at hand to assist the righteous.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:214a45e717bc5e1936f4cff5f62a75f6a91bae05","amp;dn":"Druids+1-2+The+Ogham+Sacrifice+%282009%29+%28Dragonz-L-T%29cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"214a45e717bc5e1936f4cff5f62a75f6a91bae05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,74,69,231,23,188,94,25,54,244,207,245,246,42,117,246,169,27,174,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
