This release 2009 on Columbia Legacy.\nMONO.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThis LP (which has been reissued on CD as part of Interchanges '54) introduced Paul Desmond's beautiful ballad &quot;Audrey&quot; and found the early Dave Brubeck quartet (with pianist Brubeck, altoist Desmond, bassist Bob Bates, and drummer Joe Dodge) making a rare studio recording; up to this point all of their most popular records were club performances. With fresh versions of such songs as &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; &quot;Pennies From Heaven,&quot; and &quot;A Fine Romance,&quot; this music is certainly worth acquiring. \n\n01. Audrey   \n02. Jeepers Creepers  \n03. Pennies From Heaven    \n04. Why Do I Love You ? \n05. Stompin' For Mili    \n06. Keepin' Out Of Mischief Now    \n07. A Fine Romance   \n08.
