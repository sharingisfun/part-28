Home, society and education have failed boys badly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and these failures lead to unhappy men who cannot fully become happy, responsible, emotionally-confident adults.\n\nWhile it is essential that boys spend more time learning about manhood from their fathers, Biddulph updates his classic to include helpful information for mothers and single mothers with baby boys.\n\nThis extended edition explores some important topics:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How ADHD may be caused by stress in the first year of life.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Whether boys should start school later than girls.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Help for single mothers raising sons.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to choose a sport that does more good than harm.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What we can do about boys and binge drinking.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What science can tell us about teenage boys and driving Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and how we can keep our sons safe.\n\nRaising Boys offers parents real-life situations, thought-provoking insights, humour and help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d6ef4712cbe6757753f2c182c487b484661131","amp;dn":"Raising+Boys+-+Steve+Biddulph.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d6ef4712cbe6757753f2c182c487b484661131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,214,239,71,18,203,230,117,119,83,242,193,130,196,135,180,132,102,17,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
