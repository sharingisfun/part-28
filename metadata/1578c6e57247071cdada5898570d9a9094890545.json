That left around 250 for the band to sell at \ngigs. Though it seems unlikely that all those were sold, very few have turned \nup since.\n\nMusically it\\'s a likeable, gentle collection of well-known songs sutch as \nScarborough Fair, Sweet Sir Galahad and You Ain\\'t Goin\\' Nowhere, as well \nas some folk standards. Its main assets being Cherie Musialik\\'s warm, tender \nvoice, which like the best British woman folk singers of the late \\'60s and \nearly \\'70s has a high, pristine timbre. The overall effect isn\\'t as square as on \nmany similar collections, though, with a wistful vibe and even hints of a \ndarker, more psychedelic mood emerging on several occasions.\n\n\nTracks\n1. Twelve Gates Into The City\n2. Scarborough Fair\n3. Sweet Sir Galahad\n4. Lovely Joan\n5. Circle Game\n6. Cookoo\\'s Hollerin\\'\n7. Edom O\\'gordon\n8. Victoria Dines Alone\n9. You Ain\\'t Going Nowhere\n10. Anathea\n11. National Seven\n12. Once I Knew A Pretty Girl\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1578c6e57247071cdada5898570d9a9094890545","amp;dn":"Folkal+Point+-+Super+rare+UK+private+pressing+1972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1578c6e57247071cdada5898570d9a9094890545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,120,198,229,114,71,7,28,218,218,88,152,87,13,154,144,148,137,5,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
