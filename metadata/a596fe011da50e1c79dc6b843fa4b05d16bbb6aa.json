Over the week, Alex offered up nine candidates to be put through a rigorous interview process. Three were selected to go through to a final interview. Owner Sam is upset to discover that two finalists have decided her restaurant is too remote to continue with the interview process, so Alex jumps in to redo the shortlist.\n\nTheir challenge is a tough one - to produce a three course wedding menu to be tested by a restaurant full of Sam's family and friends. They will also have to manage a brigade of chefs testing not only their cooking skills, but also their ability to run a kitchen.\n\nAs service continues, the cracks begin to show with a disastrously burnt main course and an undercooked pear dessert. It's all hands on deck if the hungry diners are going to be fed. The pressure begins to take its toll on Sam - should she make her decision based on her head or her heart?\n\nAt the end of the night, one candidate will be selected to become the new head chef - and it's a tough decision.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 19-Jun-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a596fe011da50e1c79dc6b843fa4b05d16bbb6aa","amp;dn":"Alex.Polizzi.Chefs.On.Trial.S01E12.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a596fe011da50e1c79dc6b843fa4b05d16bbb6aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,150,254,1,29,165,14,28,121,220,107,132,63,164,176,93,22,187,182,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
