The new solo album is not punk, but it does maintain a similarly hardcore DIY ethos. As a member of North Mississippi All Stars, Luther Dickinson may have innovated blues and boogie rock but he is also an acutely observant songwriter. The new album tells the story of a guy growing into a life in music.\n\nAs a member of the North Mississippi All Stars, South Memphis String Band and The Word, Luther has made himself widely known as both a talented musician and as a producer with four Grammy nominations to prove it - three in the contemporary blues category and one in traditional folk. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01.
