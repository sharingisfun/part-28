While Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ business profits plummet and theft-by-finance rises, capitalism now shifts into a mode of elimination that targets most of usÃ¢â‚¬â€along with our environmentÃ¢â‚¬â€as waste products awaiting managed disposal.\n\nThe education system is caught in the throes of this eliminationism across a number of fronts: crushing student debt, impatience with student expression, the looting of vestigial public institutions and, finally, as coup de grÃƒÂ¢ce, an abandonment of the historic ideal of universal education. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Education reformÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is powerless against eliminationism and is at best a mirage that diverts oppositional energies. \n\nThe very idea of education activism becomes a comforting fiction. Educational institutions are strapped into the eliminationist projectÃ¢â‚¬â€the neoliberal endgameÃ¢â‚¬â€in a way that admits no escape, even despite the heroic gestures of a few. The school systems that capitalism has built and directed over the last two centuries are fated to go down with the ship. It is rational therefore for educators to cultivate a certain pessimism. Should we despair? Why, yes, we shouldÃ¢â‚¬â€but cheerfully, as confronting elimination, mortality, is after all our common fate. There is nothing and everything to do in order to prepare.\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nDavid Blacker is Professor of Philosophy of Education and Legal Studies at the University of Delaware.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | US Education","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4fdbfc118eec13582b2ac77bd97276daf2459f9","amp;dn":"The+Falling+Rate+of+Learning+and+the+Neoliberal+Endgame","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4fdbfc118eec13582b2ac77bd97276daf2459f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,253,191,193,24,238,193,53,130,178,172,119,189,151,39,109,175,36,89,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
