NTSC dvd from vhs plus extra 3-minute intro.\n\nThis is the infamous PBS video that includes Larry 'Judas' Silverstein's full confession.  He brazenly gloats that the building was demolished, or &quot;pulled&quot;, only to deny that it meant to demolish.  He says the first thing he thought of when the building went down, was &quot;We should replicate what was there&quot;, only to tell a TV interviewer, only 9 days after the event, on September 20th, that he thought of the 5,000 (as yet uncounted) people and their families first, but that &quot;We should rebuild&quot;.  Complete with mayor Rudy Giu signing suckers' helmets, whilst wearing a Salvation Army smock, and plenty of grieving 9/11 victims' family members. Footage of WTC 6/7 being pulled, and plenty more.\n\n&quot;A pile of pixie-sticks&quot;, &quot;A house of cards&quot;.
