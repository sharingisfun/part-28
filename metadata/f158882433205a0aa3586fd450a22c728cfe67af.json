Iraq invades Kuwait and 170000 Indians are stranded. Ranjit Katyal a rich Indian businessman with connections up to the top of the Iraqui leadership is given a chance to escape with his family, but chooses to stay behind to assist his countrymen. He faces grave hurdles and official apathy. His attempts to evacuate people are frustrated when a ship which was to carry people home falls under an UN embargo, but Ranjit katyal does not give up.\r\n\r\nUltimately, he manages to convince the Indian foreign ministry. Air India provides planes and the Indians in Kuwait are evacuated, thanks to the efforts of a single man..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nAlthough based on a historical event, this is not a historical film. It seems to tell us that one single individual in Kuwait and one single bureaucrat in new delhi could together organise evacualtion of 170000 Indians. Reality is that it need co-ordination at every level. But historical inaccuracies notwithstanding, this is a gripping film and Akshay Kumar has probably never done a better job of acting as his Ranjit Katyal converts from a hardnosed businessman to a person driven by the need to rescue his fellow Indians. The others, including Nimrat kaur as his wife also do well, but this is Akshay Kumar's film through and through.\r\n\r\nHe is aided by some very creative cinematography by Priya Seth and fine editing by Hemanti Sarkar.\r\n\r\nRaja Menon does a good job of directing, building up a sense of urgency for the evacuation with skill. This is not a run of the mill Hindi movie. It has a plot and a sense of purpose in the direction.\r\n\r\nOverall a film to sit back, enjoy and marvel at one of the greatest stories of evacuation in Human history, which has been ignored by most media.\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThis was a T-series DVD. Need we say more? The interlacing was variable, there was ghosting everywhere, the colours were bleedin and there was an ugly yellow tint. We have tried to improve upon it as far as possible. The ghosting has been largely eliminated and the overall impact is that viewing quality is much improved.\r\n\r\nThis is a 10-bit x265 encoding and it has allowed us to compress the 2 hour film into just 1-CD with a quality that would be for a x264 rip of about 1.5 GB. The sound is 192 Kbps AAc which should allow you to enjoy full 5.1 Ch sound.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on most stand-alone devices. You can only watch this on a computer or a compatible device. On your computer be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC (2.1.5 or higher) or Media Player Classic (Ver 1.7.9) or SMPlayer (14.9.0). Earlier versions may not work\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4387040/\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine DDR release @ ExtraTorrent.com\r\n                          \nhttps://extratorrent.cc/                          \nhttps://extratorrent.com/                          \nhttp://extratorrent.ws/                          \nhttps://etproxy.com/                          \nhttps://extratorrentlive.com/                          \nhttps://extratorrentonline.com/                          \nhttps://etmirror.com/                          \nhttps://extratorrent.works/                          \nhttps://extratorrent.date/\r\n\r\n\r\nShare your Images with:\r\n                          \nhttp://extraimago.com/\r\n\r\nHelp us by donating with Bitcoin: 1XeH1kKXWYbzZcFHokGiZ4d3MWW5WyXzU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f158882433205a0aa3586fd450a22c728cfe67af","amp;dn":"AIRLIFT.%282016%29-+DVD.rip+-+HEVC-x265.AAC.Esubs+-+1+CD+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f158882433205a0aa3586fd450a22c728cfe67af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,88,136,36,51,32,90,10,163,88,111,212,80,162,44,114,140,254,103,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
