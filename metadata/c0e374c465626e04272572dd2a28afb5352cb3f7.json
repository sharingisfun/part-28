For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAbout this upload: This well made documentary goes deep into the well of time.\nOn it's way down the time line, it investigates the story of\nthis man, Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nDid He ever exist?\nHow can we tell what's true?\nAnd if He did, who was He?\n\nIf He was the one He said He was, the question becomes: Who is He?\nWhy should this be of any interest to anybody?\n\nJudging from what I can see around me in the world today, He is clearly of tremendous interest to both believers and proclaimed non-believers.\nJust mentioning His Name in favor of what He said will in most cases result in rage or taunt, and in quite many places lead to imprisonment and death..\nThat's pretty strange..\nEspecially considering how courageous, wise and loving this man actually was,\naccording to the gospels of the Bible..\n\nLee Strobel is a well renowned journalist with the Chicago Tribune.\nAt a certain time in his life he set out on a mission to fight the\npreposterous idea that Jesus of Nazareth is of any significant importance\nto anybody today, if He ever lived, that is..\n\n..oh, and feel free to check out the other torrents I've posted..

The subs are Norwegian, but the point is that you then have the positions in place for your own translation of the movie.
