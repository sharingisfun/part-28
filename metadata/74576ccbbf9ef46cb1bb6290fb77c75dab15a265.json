Pianist Hank Jones' first LP consists of six piano solos from 1947 and four trio numbers (with guitarist Johnny Smith and bassist Ray Brown) from 1953. Urbanity music CDs This CD reissue from 1997 has all of that music, plus numerous alternate takes and false starts on a pair of the 1953 Jones originals (&quot;Things Are So Pretty In the Spring&quot; and &quot;Thad's Pad&quot;). Urbanity songs Particularly on the unaccompanied solos, Hank Jones shows off the influence of Art Tatum, while the trio cuts are more boppish and sometimes recall the King Cole Trio. Urbanity album Excellent music, although the added alternates (the many stop-and-start versions of &quot;Things&quot; go on for over 14 minutes) can get a bit tedious at times. Urbanity CD music ~ Scott Yanow This is part of the Verve Elite Editions series. Recorded in 1947 and 1953. Personnel: Hank Jones (piano); Johnny Smith (guitar); Ray Brown (bass).\n\nArtist: Hank Jones\nTitle Of Album:Urbanity\nYear Of Release: 1997\nLabel: Verve\nGenre: Jazz\nTotal Time:53:58\nmp3 320\n\nTracklist :\n1 Thad's Pad [master take] (Jones) 2:56\n2 Things Are So Pretty in the Spring [master take] (Harris, Jones, Jones ) 3:38\n3 Little Girl Blue (Hart, Rodgers) 2:45\n4 Odd Number (Jones) 3:30\n5 Blues for Lady Day (Jones) 2:41\n6 The Night We Called It a Day (Adair, Dennis) 3:20\n7 Yesterdays (Harbach, Kern) 3:03\n8 You're BlasÃƒÂ© (Hamilton, Sievier) 3:06\n9 Tea for Two (Caesar, Youmans) 3:00\n10 The Blue Room (Hart, Rodgers) 2:42\n11 Thad's Pad [alt. take] (Jones) 3:00\n12 Thad's Pad [index 1-2 : false start - inc. take] (Jones) 0:12\n13 Thad's Pad [alt. take] (Jones) 0:19\n14 Thad's Pad [index 0-1 : false start - alt. take] (Jones) 2:58\n15 Things Are So Pretty in the Spring [index 1-4 : false start] (Harris, Jones, Jones) 0:14\n16 Things Are So Pretty in the Spring [alt. take] (Harris, Jones, Jones) 3:36\n17 Things Are So Pretty in the Spring [alt. take] (Harris, Jones, Jones) 3:39\nRead more at http://www.israbox.com/1146373809-hank-jones-urbanity-1997.html#IbRpubaTsWqD5Bxb.99\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74576ccbbf9ef46cb1bb6290fb77c75dab15a265","amp;dn":"Hank+Jones+-+Urbanity+%5B1953%5D+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74576ccbbf9ef46cb1bb6290fb77c75dab15a265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,87,108,203,191,158,244,108,177,187,98,144,251,119,199,93,171,21,162,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
