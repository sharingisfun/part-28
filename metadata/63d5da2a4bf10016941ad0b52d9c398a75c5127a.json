The book begins by acquainting students with the meaning of personality and providing them with a solid foundation for understanding the nature of theory, as well as its crucial contributions to science. The chapters that follow present twenty-three major theories: coverage of each theory also encompasses a biographical sketch of each theorist, related research, and applications to real life. The primary focus of this revision was updating the theory chapters to reflect the most recent research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d5da2a4bf10016941ad0b52d9c398a75c5127a","amp;dn":"Theories+of+Personality+%287e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d5da2a4bf10016941ad0b52d9c398a75c5127a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,213,218,42,75,241,0,22,148,26,208,181,45,156,57,138,117,197,18,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
