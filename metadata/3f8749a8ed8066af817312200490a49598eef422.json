He is a physician and she is a teacher, and they have three grown daughters and a comfortable home. Yet what binds them together isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only affection and solidarity but also the painful facts of their respective histories, which they keep hidden even from their own children. But after the abrupt dismissal of their housekeeper and SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increasing withdrawal into himself, the past can no longer be repressed.\n\nLindstrÃƒÂ¸m has crafted a masterpiece about the grave mistakes we make when we misjudge the legacy of war, common prejudices, and our own strategies of survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f8749a8ed8066af817312200490a49598eef422","amp;dn":"Days+in+the+History+of+Silence+-+Merethe+Lindstrom.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f8749a8ed8066af817312200490a49598eef422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,135,73,168,237,128,102,175,129,115,18,32,4,144,164,149,152,238,244,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
