His records with his group, Brasil '66, regularly straddled the domestic pop and international markets in America, getting played heavily on AM radio stations, both rock and easy listening, and he gave his label, A&amp;M, something to offer light jazz listeners beyond the work of the company's co-founder, Herb Alpert. During this period, he also became an international music star and one of the most popular musicians in South America. \n\n\nGenre................: Latin Jazz\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) (44 KHz-16 bit)\nLabel.................: A&amp;M Records\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Mais Que Nada\n02.One Note Samba/Spanish Flea\n03.Bim Bom\n04.Look Around\n05.(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay\n06.Watch What Happens\n07.With A Little Help From My Friends\n08.Look Of Love\n09.Norwegian Wood\n10.Wave\n11.After Midnight\n12.Chelsea Morning\n13.Fool On The Hill\n14.For What It's Worth\n15.Day Tripper\n16.Crystal Illuions (Memorias De Marta Sare)\n17.Pais Tropical\n18.Ye-Me-Le\n19.Lai Ladaia (Reza)\n20.Promise Of A Fisherman\n21.After Sunrise\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7881f90e969e364d303c77d39356f9dd15653d2","amp;dn":"Sergio+Mendes+%2B+Brasil+%2766+-+Foursider+%281988%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7881f90e969e364d303c77d39356f9dd15653d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,136,31,144,233,105,227,100,211,3,199,125,57,53,111,157,209,86,83,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
