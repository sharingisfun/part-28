My notes are original.  The torrent is given because this better copy of the documentary was no longer maintained.  My thanks to the original torrent maker.\n\n  \n  Signals Through The Flames documents the Living Theater of Julian Beck and Judith Melina.\n\n  It is the story of political action expressed through experimental theater and is for those archival purposes of theater history and lessons from the movement.\n\n  The original VHS is out of print.  Mystic Fire has not duplicated the film to dvd.\n\n  Please contact them if you think this work is worth preserving for a new generation of theater experimenters.  A few copies of the VHS exist but they are difficult to find.  \n\n\n  Julian Beck died in 1985 of stomach cancer.  Judith Melina continues to work\nas a director of The Living Theater in New York City.\n\n  Living Theater maintains a website with information on new productions:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.livingtheatre.org/.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.livingtheatre.org/.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  A wiki is maintained for the Living Theater as well:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Theatre&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Theatre&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes written June 25th, 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc16c29861c51e1312cc0ee346a5fe9b06bc880b","amp;dn":"Signals+Through+The+Flames%3A+a+documentary+on+The+Living+Theater+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc16c29861c51e1312cc0ee346a5fe9b06bc880b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,22,194,152,97,197,30,19,18,204,14,227,70,165,254,155,6,188,136,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
