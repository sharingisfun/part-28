It is thought to have been created in the early 13th century in the Benedictine monastery of PodlaÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ice in Bohemia (modern Czech Republic). It contains the Vulgate Bible as well as many historical documents all written in Latin. During the Thirty Years\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' War in 1648, the entire collection was taken by the Swedish army as plunder, and now it is preserved at the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm, though it is not normally on display\n\nTHE BOOKS LEGEND!!\n\nAccording to one version of a legend that is already recorded in the Middle Ages the scribe was a monk who broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled up alive. In order to forbear this harsh penalty he promised to create in one single night a book to glorify the monastery forever, including all human knowledge. Near midnight he became sure that he could not complete this task alone, so he made a special prayer, not addressed to God but to the fallen angel Lucifer, asking him to help him finish the book in exchange for his soul. The devil completed the manuscript and the monk added the devil\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s picture out of gratitude for his aid.[1][14][15] In tests to recreate the work, it is estimated that in order to reproduce only the calligraphy, without the illustrations or embellishments, would have taken 5 years of non-stop writing.\n\n\nPLEASE ENJOY AND PLEASE SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02ec0d5f4d7914e52ed4e797b361c0e89554a507","amp;dn":"Codex+Gigas+aka.THE+DEVILS+BIBLE%21%21+13th+Century+Book.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02ec0d5f4d7914e52ed4e797b361c0e89554a507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,236,13,95,77,121,20,229,46,212,231,151,179,97,192,232,149,84,165,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
