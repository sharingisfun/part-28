Close analysis of sources with special interest in embassies offers insight into a variety of genres: chronicles, panegyrics, hagiographies, letters, and epitaphs. The study will make a significant contribution to the developing field of ancient and medieval communication.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0256b30f4f23b1016be9f630ec2356fbdb27807b","amp;dn":"Envoys+and+Political+Communication+in+the+Late+Antique+West%2C+411","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0256b30f4f23b1016be9f630ec2356fbdb27807b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,86,179,15,79,35,177,1,107,233,246,48,236,35,86,251,219,39,128,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
