It was released on 27 November 2006; however pre-release CDs were available for sale to members of his site's mailing list.\n \nThe album is almost entirely performed by Steve, apart from snare drum on Yellow Dog and crash cymbal on Fallen Off a Rock, performed by H.J. Wold (a relation of Steve, whose real name is Steve Wold)\n \nThe album reached #37 in the UK album charts, #2 in the independent album charts, and #31 in the downloads chart, all three from sales in the UK\n\n\nSeasick Steve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A sixty-seventy-something year old (ex)-Hobo from Mississippi who over the last 5 years or so has gone from zero to hero. I guess it must have a lot to do with how authentic he is, as far removed from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“popÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ scene as possible, apparently he still lives in a banged out old camper that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had forever. The only difference is that now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of Jack Daniels Whiskey cosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they wanted to sponsor him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7686ba72b39d22e3c8665dd6316deebd0d1cbcb4","amp;dn":"Seasick+Steve+-+Doghouse+Music+-+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7686ba72b39d22e3c8665dd6316deebd0d1cbcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,134,186,114,179,157,34,227,200,102,93,214,49,109,238,189,13,28,188,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
