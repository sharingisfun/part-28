Evans portrays a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. Interweaving a broad narrative of the war's progress from a wide range of people, Evans reveals the dynamics of a society plunged into war at every level. The great battles and events of the conflict are here, but just as telling is Evans's re- creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermiÃ‚Â­nation of the Jews. The final book in Richard J. Evan's three-volume history of Hitler's Germany, hailed &quot;a masterpiece&quot; by The New York Times, The Third Reich at War lays bare the most momentous and tragic years of the Nazi regime.\n\nThe jews STOLE Palestine and renamed it Israel!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18157eabda18bb1781b6ab2fb6bc027d4868193c","amp;dn":"The+Third+Reich+at+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18157eabda18bb1781b6ab2fb6bc027d4868193c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,21,126,171,218,24,187,23,129,182,171,47,182,188,2,125,72,104,25,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
