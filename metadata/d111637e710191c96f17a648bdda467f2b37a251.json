Only crew members Rand and Shapiro survive. The men stare out over the sand dunes and remark on how the planet is similar to a beach. Rand, who is slowly becoming insane, refuses to move from the dune he is sitting on or to drink water.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d111637e710191c96f17a648bdda467f2b37a251","amp;dn":"12+-+Beachworld.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d111637e710191c96f17a648bdda467f2b37a251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,17,99,126,113,1,145,201,111,23,166,72,189,218,70,127,43,55,162,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
