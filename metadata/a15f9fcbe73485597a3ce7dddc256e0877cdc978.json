The entire game is steeped in an ancient Egyptian theme, with locations that range from claustrophobic temple passages to wide-open arenas, and with surprises lurking around every corner.\n\nThe monsters are uninspired, but Serious Sam substitutes quantity for quality. Enemies do little more than blindly rush at you, but when dozens are converging on your position at the same time things get hectic in a hurry. Fortunately there are plenty of health, armor, and ammunition packs to pick up along the way, so expect a sore trigger finger after fighting all the way through to the game's epic end battle.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\n- AMD K6-3 400MHz or Celeron 300MHz\n- 64MB RAM\n- Full OpenGL compliant 3D accelerator\n- 100% Windows compatible sound card\n- Windows 95OSR2/98/98SE/ME/NT 4.0 (with Service Pack 5) or Windows 2000\n- 150MB free hard disk space\n\nRecommended System Requirements:\n\n- AMD Athlon 550MHz or Pentium III 550MHz processor\n- 128MB RAM\n- Full OpenGL compliant 3D accelerator with 32MB RAM on-board memory\n- Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live!\n- 450MB free hard disk space\n\nHowever, if you want to enjoy the game in all it's glory, the following\nrequirements are needed:\n\n- AMD Thunderbird 800MHz or Pentium III 800MHz processor\n- 256MB RAM\n- Third generation full OpenGL compliant 3D accelerator with 32MB RAM\non-board memory (example: GeForce 2 GTS or GeForce MX)\n\n[ R i p p e d ]\n\nMusic\n\nInstructions:1) run setup windows batch file,wait a few minutes(to extract) then 2)run RegSetup,\n3)to play go to bin folder then run SeriousSam.exe\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER YOUR FINISH DOWNLOADING","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a15f9fcbe73485597a3ce7dddc256e0877cdc978","amp;dn":"Serious+Sam%3A+The+First+Encounter%5BRIP%5D143MB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a15f9fcbe73485597a3ce7dddc256e0877cdc978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,95,159,203,231,52,133,89,122,60,231,221,220,37,110,8,119,205,201,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
