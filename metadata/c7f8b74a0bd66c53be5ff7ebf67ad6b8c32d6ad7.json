The couple love industrial buildings and have purchased a pumping station, intent on turning it into a design haven. But with costs mounting, as they continue to delay decision making, the couple are in danger of having to refinance in order to finish the build.\n\n2)  Flint Mill \nAlan Appleby and his wife Dora might be restoration experts, but they've never taken on a project as ambitious as this. They've saved a flint mill in Stone, Staffordshire that's on the verge of falling down. Alan is a building surveyor, and shouldn't have a problem fixing the massive structural damage. But his passion for old buildings soon takes over and they end up ploughing everything they have into this build. George Clarke helps them every step of the way and uncovers its unique history and the link between this building and the world renowned pottery and ceramics of Josiah Wedgwood.\n\n3)  Fisherman's Church \nHaving never lived together before, architect Neil Worrell and his partner Jackie Robinson decided to cement their relationship by purchasing a forgotten church in the picture perfect fishing town of Brixham in Devon. What began as a project that would bring them closer together becomes the ultimate test as the restoration pushes them to their limits. George Clarke brings his own design expertise to the project to help them realise their dream; and at the same time discovers the rich history that links this church directly to Brixham's celebrated fishing community.\n\n4)  Welsh School \nRecession-hit builders Ian and Jayne Hall Edwards face a massive battle converting a huge derelict Victorian school in a Welsh hillside village in Carmarthenshire into both a place of business and a home.Having failed to win a grant to help finance the build, they are left battling through harsh winters while living in a caravan on site, and with their family business hanging in the balance.\n\n5)  Cow Barn \nMarco and Kath Walker take over a pair of Grade II listed 17th and 18th century cow barns from their local farmer in Wellington, Herefordshire. The barns are tumbling down, the couple have their two young children in tow, they've never done anything like this before and are complete restoration novices, and the project is beset with problems from the start. George offers much needed advice throughout the build and discovers how these buildings and the surrounding farm helped to revolutionise cattle farming in the UK.\n\n6)  RAF Bunker \nFurniture maker Jamie Brown has big ideas about turning a colossal and historic 15,000 square foot RAF bunker from World War II into his new home. However, with the Nottinghamshire bunker totally encased in earth, with no natural light, and the back section submerged in water, Jamie's wife, who is about to have their first baby, isn't so sure. With its fascinating history and jaw-dropping engineering, George helps Jamie tackle this huge undertaking and discovers the important role it played in the blitz.\n\n7)  Telford Church Revisit \nGeorge Clarke revisits Keith and Sheena McIntyre to see if their struggles have paid off. They fought through terrible weather conditions, and a challenge to integrate with the local community, in order to restore a stunning but isolated Telford church on the remote island of Berneray in the Outer Hebrides. A year later, George Clarke returns to find out if they've managed to transform the church into a working artist's studio, what life is like in the new community, and to see if they've been successful in winning a prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland award.\n\n8)  Water Mill \nGeorge returns to Thrum Mill to meet Dave and Margaret Heldey who have battled through flooding and serious illness to restore one of Northumberland's most stunning but abandoned water mills. Dave, an experienced amateur builder, has poured his heart and soul into every aspect of the restoration, and has had to deal with no less than 18 planning restrictions.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/1709/q1qi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/1709/q1qi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/2589/oqxu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/2589/oqxu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/666/fybg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/666/fybg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2314/ib6x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2314/ib6x.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/7506/xsok.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/7506/xsok.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2577/cy9v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2577/cy9v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/5273/ia9h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/5273/ia9h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/5060/suad.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/5060/suad.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/5945/iiqa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/5945/iiqa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4008292728000c746e71&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3183 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.05 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clarke_%28architect%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clarke_%28architect%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Restoration%20Man%3A%20Series%201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Restoration%20Man%3A%20Series%201&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Restoration%20Man%3A%20Series%202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Restoration%20Man%3A%20Series%202&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f8b74a0bd66c53be5ff7ebf67ad6b8c32d6ad7","amp;dn":"The+Restoration+Man+Series+3+7of8+Telford+Church+Revisit+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f8b74a0bd66c53be5ff7ebf67ad6b8c32d6ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,248,183,74,11,214,108,83,190,95,247,235,246,122,214,184,195,45,106,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
