ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a nice place to visit, but you wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to live there. Part monologue and part telephone conversation, WireTap ushers you into the endearingly odd, funny universe of JonathanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friends and family. The Montreal Gazette calls the show &quot;something between borscht-belt comedy and Franz Kafka&quot; and the Toronto Star describes it as &quot;[pitting] the absurd against the plausible. The sense is of a world not completely unlike our own that runs parallel... conversation, storytelling and introspection, culled from equal parts real-world experience and the warp of Goldstein's imagination.&quot; WireTap was awarded the Gold World Medal for Best Regularly Scheduled Comedy Program at The New York Festivals in 2006.\n\nWireTap is produced by Jonathan Goldstein, with Mira Burt-Wintonick and Carolyn Warren, and with production assistance from Cristal Duhaime.\n\nThis is the COMPLETE 28 episodes from Season Two of WireTap.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8e80ef4a998f17a5f5e4568c3d29c2c2750b194","amp;dn":"CBC+Radio+WireTap+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8e80ef4a998f17a5f5e4568c3d29c2c2750b194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,232,14,244,169,152,241,122,95,94,69,104,195,210,156,44,39,80,177,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
