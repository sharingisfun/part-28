One could of course say that one is in a state of consciousness. Similar to how one could say that one is in a state of walking.\nBut then it is much simpler to say that one is conscious, and one is walking.\nIt just sounds more scientific to use the word 'state'. \nBut what is consciousness and the process of walking are unattainable by using the 'state'. \nThe characteristic feature of a state is that time plays no part. It is, as it were, a picture, taken with an infinitely small shutter time. \nOne will regularly be faced with the terms &quot;a brain state&quot; or &quot;a state of consciousness&quot; in American and English publications especially.\nSo why is the word &quot;state&quot; so endearing to use? After all, it should be clear that the brain never remains in the same state","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:427f9116a33022d63a6dfb5d732f697b3bcc57a8","amp;dn":"A+brain+state%2C+mostly+nonsense.docx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"427f9116a33022d63a6dfb5d732f697b3bcc57a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,127,145,22,163,48,34,214,58,109,251,93,115,47,105,123,59,204,87,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
