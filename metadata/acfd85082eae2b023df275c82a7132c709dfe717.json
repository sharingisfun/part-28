You die every night and spawn as a ghost trying to resurrect.\n\nScare villagers out of their wits and grab their soul power during the midnight hour in order to resurrect!\n\nOverview:\n\nClifftown is haunted. The innocent villagers never asked for any of this spookening to happen, but neither did you ask to die each and every night with the knowledge that the villagers Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soular PowerÃ¢â‚¬Å“ could bring you back to life.\n\nIn The Spookening you enter as Hero Hermans ghost. Can you change Hermans fate, and give him a chance for another day among the living?\n\nBy learning the rules of the world beyond, you will gain the skill and the wit to take precious Ã¢â‚¬Å“soular powerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the living. By using this power and pouring it into your former meat shell you get a chance to live once more.\n\nBut things on the other side are seldom this easy. Other beings from beyond view you as a trespasser and will protect their turf. Vengeful spirits form when your scaring goes too far, and demons living in the shadows will be after you.\nSave yourself! At any cost?\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Integration of Immersions tactile effects.\n- 120.000 square meters of realtime shaded 3D world.\n- Supernatural game play where you die at the beginning of each level and spawn as a ghost.\n- A total of 20 nights for you to clear at three levels.\n- You'll encounter demons, ghosts, spirits and the ultimate bad guy of them all...\n- 19 different types of supernatural interactive items that awaits your exploration.\n- 8 different skills and items available in the crypt shop.\n- 3D particle effects.\n- Online High Score feature.
