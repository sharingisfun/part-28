So keep your eyes and ears open for signs of a coming uprising, such as:\n\nCivil unrest prior to riots in the major cities.\nPoliticians and media blatantly lying about the most obvious developments.\nCensorship of social networks such as Twitter or Facebook. This may not be entirely obvious at first but when the sites are blocked completely the warnings are clear (with excuses like child pornography).\nCensorship of old media such as newspapers and television (non-regime critical press).\nArrests of political opposition leaders (In Tunisia the leaders of the Pirate Party were rounded up and imprisoned without charge. The prison was subsequently burnt down with many people dying inside).\nIn times of crisis many rumours will spread around and fear mongering is rampant. Be calm, think before you act rashly.\nThe #Hashtag of your country, or name of your political leader is trending worldwide on Twitter.\nFriends and family members living abroad may try to contact you to check if you are alright.\nFull Anonymous Survival Guide For Citizens in Revolution (v1.0)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:568115575e8e3863045572c3db5e757bc00b8bde","amp;dn":"Anonymous+Survival+Guide+for+Citizens+in+a+Revolution+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"568115575e8e3863045572c3db5e757bc00b8bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,129,21,87,94,142,56,99,4,85,114,195,219,94,117,123,192,11,139,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
