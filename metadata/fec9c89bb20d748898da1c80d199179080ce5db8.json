This coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England whose first monarch was Henry VII (1457 h 1509). The term can be used more broadly to include Elizabeth I's reign (1558 h 1603), although this is often treated separately as the Elizabethan era. The Tudor rulers disliked the term &quot;Tudor&quot; (because the first Tudor was low-born), and it was not much used before the late 18th century. The term Tudor was hardly used in the 16th century and many phrases of periodization used by modern historians, such as Tudor England and Tudor monarchy which seek to emphasize a distinct period, are misleading compared to what people actually experienced at the time\n\nFiles:\n\nA PDF collection of 53 eBooks about the Tudor period\neBooks are sorted on publisher's name\n\nAshgate Publishing Defending Royal Supremacy and Discerning God's Will in Tudor England (2007).pdf\nAshgate Publishing The Church of Mary Tudor (2006).pdf\nBlackwell Publishing A Companion to Tudor Britain (2004).pdf\nBlackwell Publishing A Companion to Tudor Literature (2010).pdf\nBlackwell Publishing Lady Jane Grey, A Tudor Mystery (2009).pdf\nBoydell Press Humphrey Newton 1466-1536, An Early Tudor Gentleman (2008).pdf\nBrill Publishing The Zurich Connection and Tudor Political Theology (2007).pdf\nBrill Publishing Tudor Protestant Political Thought 1547-1603 (2011).pdf\nCambridge University Press Law and Government under the Tudors, Essays Presented to Sir Geoffrey Elton (1988).pdf\nCambridge University Press Literacy and the Social Order, Reading and Writing in Tudor and Stuart England (1980).pdf\nCambridge University Press Mercy and Authority in the Tudor State (2003).pdf\nCambridge University Press Of Prelates and Princes, A Study of the Economic and Social Position of the Tudor Episcopate (1980).pdf\nCambridge University Press Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government Papers and Reviews 1946-1972 Vol. 1 (1974).pdf\nCambridge University Press Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government Papers and Reviews 1946-1972 Vol. 2 (1974).pdf\nCambridge University Press Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government Papers and Reviews 1946-1972 Vol. 3 (1983).pdf\nCambridge University Press Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government Papers and Reviews 1946-1972 Vol. 4 (1992).pdf\nCambridge University Press The Chief Governors, The Rise and Fall of Reform Government in Tudor Ireland 1536-1588 (1994).pdf\nCambridge University Press The Horse Trade of Tudor and Stuart England (1988).pdf\nCambridge University Press The Italian Encounter with Tudor England, A Cultural Politics of Translation (2005).pdf\nCambridge University Press The Religious Orders in England Vol. 3, The Tudor Age (1979) (no OCR).pdf\nCambridge University Press The Tudor Revolution in Government, Administrative Changes in the Reign of Henry VIII (1953).pdf\nContinuum International Publishing J.A.
