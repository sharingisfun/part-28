It was through his efforts in the 1930s and 40s that the National Trust has so many grand houses. These three dramas look at 3 episodes in his life, all drawn from his diaries:\n\nEp 1 - The National Trust has been evacuated to West Wycombe Park, the owner of which is desperate to offload to the National Trust.\n\nEp 2 - Death stalks Lees-Milne. His friend the pro-German Tom Mitford (brother of Nancy) goes to fight in Burma and he strikes up a strange friendship with a woman he never meets. A very sad episode.\n\nEp 3 - James spends time at Farringdon, with the bizarre Lord Berners and his strange menage a trois.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b745b9c2cdc8c3e930f7b1bc55f33a9f47ae602","amp;dn":"James+Lees-Milne+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b745b9c2cdc8c3e930f7b1bc55f33a9f47ae602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,116,91,156,44,220,140,62,147,15,123,27,197,95,51,169,244,122,230,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
