That's kind of surprising.  Well here it is anyway.\n\nDescription: Mac Hall (debut: November 7, 2000) is a webcomic which was created through a bet between the creator Ian McConville and a friend who claimed he &quot;couldn't make a comic like Penny Arcade&quot;.[3] After the fifteenth comic, McConville was joined by Matt Boyd who began to write the comic.[4]\n\nMac Hall follows the exploits of a group of college students who are typical slackers. The series primarily focused on the events that occurred between classes and after hours and only rarely references actual class work. The comic takes its name from MacDonald Hall, a dormitory at Bowling Green State University. Later in the series, the cast moves into a house, where they reside until graduation, and the comic's conclusion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a3d5a1c6cec7021a96664149a9148324ebb207","amp;dn":"Mac+Hall+Webcomic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a3d5a1c6cec7021a96664149a9148324ebb207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,163,213,161,198,206,199,2,26,150,102,65,73,169,20,131,36,235,178,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
