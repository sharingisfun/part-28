The film follows the life of notorious prisoner Michael Gordon Peterson, who was renamed Charles Bronson by his fight promoter. Born into a respectable middle-class family, Peterson would nevertheless become one of the United Kingdom's most dangerous criminals, and is known for having spent almost his entire adult life in solitary confinement. Bronson is narrated with humour, blurring the line between comedy and horror.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28b2b77ebbd396519e1eab31da9863e6b711d28a","amp;dn":"Bronson+%28With+Greek+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28b2b77ebbd396519e1eab31da9863e6b711d28a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,178,183,126,187,211,150,81,158,30,171,49,218,152,99,230,183,17,210,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
