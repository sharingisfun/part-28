But more significantly, whoever studies them well will gain superhuman powers in the engame.\n\n\n\nMr. Nunn also wrote a few other well-regarded books on the endgame:\n\n\n\nTactical Chess Endings should be worth studying. I've read that the other two are a bit academic (unpractically esoteric).\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1defd50f05859998824835020615e75ad539cac1","amp;dn":"Chess+Endgame+-+John+Nunn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1defd50f05859998824835020615e75ad539cac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,239,213,15,5,133,153,152,130,72,53,2,6,21,231,90,213,57,202,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
