Filmed April 6-9, 2012, Sarasota, FL\n\nThis second of three Sliders-12 workshops heralded the beginning of NET EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Team KrystosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Al-Hum-Bhra Host Mission. This new upgrade in the Kristos Mission commenced with opening of something called the Miotic Planes and the Councils of 48, a huge collective of Krystic CosMAyah Beings also referred to as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Krystal PeopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The Krystal People represent the RhAya-Phim Races who manifest as Krystal RhAy Ships, and who are coming together in an extraordinary way in our EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmosphere to form the massive Mirror in the Sky that will be reflecting back a large portion of the reversed frequencies (including the powerful reversed Violet Plasma Ray of Consumption) during the up-and-coming months. As part of this most recent Mission upgrade, the hosting parts of our Metagalaxy (MG) will be drawn through into the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœadjugate alignmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from MG-6; GL-3; SS-3 into MG-12; GL-12; Sol-5; Stella-3.
