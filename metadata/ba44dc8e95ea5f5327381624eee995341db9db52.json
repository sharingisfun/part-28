The air war effectively ended at 10.58am on August 9th 1945, when a solitary B-29 Superfortress over the Japanese city of Nagasaki dropped the second atomic bomb. The Stukas carried 250kg bombs: the a-bomb dropped by the B-29 was equivalent to 23,000 tons of TNT. In just six years of warfare, air power had changed and grown in destruction capability almost beyond recognition.
