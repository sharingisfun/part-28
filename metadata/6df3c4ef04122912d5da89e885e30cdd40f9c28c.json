It ended in February/March 2014.\n\nFoundations of Teaching for Learning is a program of study primarily for people who are currently teaching but have had no formal teacher education. This course is an introductory one that considers the three domains of being a teacher: Professional Knowledge and Understanding; Professional Practice; and Professional Values, Relationships and Engagement.\n\nThis introductory course explains how the seven other courses in the program will assist you to improve your understanding of your role and work as a teacher.  This set of courses will enhance your knowledge and understanding about learning and teaching and what makes a teacher a professional. \n\nPractical activities are provided to assist you in using what you have learned to improve your teaching practice.  While these are optional, it is strongly recommended that you undertake them if at all possible.\n\nOf particular importance is a guide to the development of a portfolio to help you organize and document your thinking about what you have learned. In addition, you may be able to use the portfolio to access other opportunities in the future. \n\nThe program consists of the following courses:\n\n- Introduction\n- Being a Teacher\n- Learners and Learning\n- Curriculum\n- Planning for Teaching and Learning\n- Introduction to Student Assessment\n- Being a Professional\n- Developing Relationships \n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/teach1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df3c4ef04122912d5da89e885e30cdd40f9c28c","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Foundations+of+Teaching+for+Learning+1+-+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df3c4ef04122912d5da89e885e30cdd40f9c28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,243,196,239,4,18,41,18,213,218,137,232,133,227,12,221,64,249,194,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
