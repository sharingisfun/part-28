CPO violinist Sonja van Beekâ€™s round and honeyed tone may not be the biggest out there, but itâ€™s just right for this setting. Her intonation is better than Derek Hahnâ€™s, the violinist on ASV. Both she and pianist Andreas FrÃ¶lich successfully navigate the many moods of Korngoldâ€™s Violin Sonata, although FrÃ¶lich is freer with the rhythm than ASVâ€™s Andrew Ball. Some listeners may wish for a wider, looser vibrato at times, but van Beek captures just the right blend of nobility and charm in the engaging and technically challenging Scherzo. CPOâ€™s sound isnâ€™t as full as it might be, so van Beekâ€™s upper register occasionally sounds anemic.\r\nThe duo plays beautifully in Korngoldâ€™s own transcription of Mariettaâ€™s Lute Song from Die tote Stadtâ€“and FrÃ¶lich is especially effective in adding warmth and color to this music. The rest of the program is equally delightful, highlighted by van Beekâ€™s impish harmonicsâ€“always in tuneâ€“in the Caprice fantastique, and the lazy dreaminess of the Tanzlied des Pierot (also arranged from Die tote Stadt). Violinist Toscha Seidel has a bit more schmaltz and swing in his rendition of the Much Ado About Nothing suite (Complete Victor Recordings set on Biddulph), but van Beekâ€™s version is more technically polished and arguably just as satisfying. In all, this is a disc for Korngold fans and for listeners interested in accessible, intelligently written, skillfully played violin music.&quot; --David Vernier\r\n\r\nViolin Sonata op. 6 in G\r\n01.
