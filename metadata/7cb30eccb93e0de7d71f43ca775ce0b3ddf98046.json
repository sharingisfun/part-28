ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not their music or\never-changing image that's the problem. It's Corey's lack of lyrics. He just can't\nthink of anything cool to write about, until... he finds his older sister Trina's\ndiary. &quot;Hey! This thing is full of teen angst and junk.&quot; Core and the band\n'secretly' use her latest diary entry for lyrics to their new tune - and what do\nyou know?
