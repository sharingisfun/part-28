Says Hunter, a\n      die-hard Cowboys fan: &quot;I named it for the love of the state.\n      I assumed somebody had named their album &amp;#039;Texas&amp;#039; before, but\n      no one had. I had to do it before someone else did!&quot;\n\n      The songs showcase a slightly heavier guitar sound, but\n      maintain Hunter&amp;#039;s quirky outlook and pop aesthetic. &quot;I\n      actually write my guitar stuff first,&quot; says themusician.\n      &quot;Then I compliment it with some beats or keyboards.&quot; But\n      whatever the case, there&amp;#039;s definitely diversity at work. The\n      ballad &quot;Pirate and Princess&quot; features almost orchestral\n      flourishes, while &quot;Tooth Decay&quot; is more acoustic-based. The\n      album also marks the first time Hunter has worked with a\n      producer (Garrett Lee) and live drums.\n\n      Although the Postal Service and &quot;poptronica&quot; have been used\n      to describe PlayRadioPlay!&amp;#039;s gentle beats and\n      keyboard-centric songs, Hunter has created his own phrase to\n      describe the sound. &quot;It&amp;#039;s Texas Straight-edge Softcore,&quot; he\n      says, laughing. &quot;I mean, I&amp;#039;m making fun of straight-edge\n      hardcore? a genre that I am not. Why can&amp;#039;t there be\n      straight-edge softcore?&quot;\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________\n\n      01-loco commotion                                          04:23\n      02-i&amp;#039;m a pirate, you&amp;#039;re a princess                         05:08\n      03-some crap about the furniture                           05:11\n      04-madi don&amp;#039;t leave                                        05:40\n      05-without gravity                                         04:01\n      06-see you soon                                            04:05\n      07-i&amp;#039;m afraid there&amp;#039;s a hole in my brain                   04:02\n      08-more of the worst                                       04:49\n      09-my attendance is bad but my intentions are good         04:30\n      10-corner office bedroom                                   04:08\n      11-forgiveness, the enviable trait                         02:22\n      12-texas                                                   00:59\n                                                                -------\n                                                                 49:18 min   _______________________________________________________________________\n\n        ews","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a56c4c3577b92954ae9983d14ff51813dcb95641","amp;dn":"Playradioplay-Texas-2008-PLAYRADIOPLAY_INT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a56c4c3577b92954ae9983d14ff51813dcb95641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,108,76,53,119,185,41,84,174,153,131,209,79,245,24,19,220,185,86,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
