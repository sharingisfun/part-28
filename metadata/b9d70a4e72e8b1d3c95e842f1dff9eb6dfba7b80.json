The discovery of two small bite marks on FloraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neck leads Mr Marchdale, an old friend of the family, to the conclusion that she was bitten by a vampire. While Flora recovers, her brother Henry and Mr Marchdale begin their hunt for the vampire. Their suspicions soon fall on the mysterious Sir Francis Varney, who has just bought an old abbey near Bannersworth Hall, and who bears an uncanny resemblance to Marmaduke Bannersworth, a long-dead ancestor of the family.\n\nThe following romance is collected from seemingly the most authentic sources, and the Author must leave the question of credibility entirely to his readers, not even thinking that he is peculiarly called upon to express his own opinion upon the subject. Nothing has been omitted in the life of the unhappy Varney, which could tend to throw a light upon his most extraordinary career, and the fact of his death just as it is here related, made a great noise at the time through Europe and is to be found in the public prints for the year 1713.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d70a4e72e8b1d3c95e842f1dff9eb6dfba7b80","amp;dn":"Varney+the+Vampire+by+Thomas+Preskett+Prest+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d70a4e72e8b1d3c95e842f1dff9eb6dfba7b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,215,10,78,114,232,177,211,201,94,132,47,29,255,158,182,223,186,123,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
