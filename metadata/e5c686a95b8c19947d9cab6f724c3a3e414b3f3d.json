Out of the Blue was originally released in 1994.\n\nThis disc is the &quot;Roma&quot; of the Bleach era. You will not find a better sounding Bleach era show. \n\nThis is what a bootleg recordings are all about... You can also get this show on it&amp;#039;s clone &quot;Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man.&quot; The show was recorded for radio in Austria, and the sound is perfect. You may prefer this over it&amp;#039;s clone &quot;Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man&quot; if you appreciate extra artwork. &quot;Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man&quot; contains tracks from another show that are not available on this disc. \n\nYou can tell the band was having a good time at this show. The setlist was typical (except for the encore), however, the unique thing about the show is a drunk guy that screams at the band throughout their performance. You hear this guy with a German accent screaming &quot;PLAY ABOUT F@@@ING GIRLS!!!!&quot;... &quot;TUNE YOUR F@@@ING GUITAR AND PLAY ABOUT F@@@ING GIRLS, MAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!&quot;... Krist has a good time with him and yells back several times during the show and at one point sings some lines from The Who&amp;#039;s &quot;I&amp;#039;m a Boy&quot; and dedicates it to the heckler. The entire show is wild and full of energy. \n\n&quot;Help me, I&amp;#039;m Hungry&quot; is played as an encore, and is the best known recording of the song. You can hear some kind of sound repeating in the background when the band breaks between songs... I think it&amp;#039;s soundclips of Arnold S... (the Terminator guy), there must be a reason, because the repeating sounds can be heard during other 1989 German shows.\n\n\nMislabels: \n&quot;Sappy&quot; Labeled As &quot;Another Rule&quot; \n\nOther Disc(s) Containing This Date: \nU4 - Vienna Austria 11-22-89\n   Play The F***ing Guitar, Man!!\n   Smells Like Nirvana\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/bootography/review45bd.html?filename=outoftheblue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/bootography/review45bd.html?filename=outoftheblue&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c686a95b8c19947d9cab6f724c3a3e414b3f3d","amp;dn":"Nirvana+--+Out+of+the+Blue+--+++%2ARARE%2A++320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c686a95b8c19947d9cab6f724c3a3e414b3f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,198,134,169,91,140,25,148,125,156,171,111,114,76,58,62,65,75,63,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
