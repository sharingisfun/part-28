This Second Edition features exciting new information on Earth and planetary evolution and examines how all subsystems in our planet-crust, mantle, core, atmosphere, oceans and life-have worked together and changed over time. Kent Condie synthesizes data from the fields of oceanography, geophysics, planetology, and geochemistry to address Earth's evolution.\n\n\n    * Slides of all figures in the book can be downloaded on ElsevierDirect.com: http://www.elsevierdirect.com/companion.jsp?ISBN=9780123852274\n\n    * Kent Condie's corresponding interactive CD, Plate Tectonics and How the Earth Works, can be purchased from Tasa Graphic Arts here: http://www.tasagraphicarts.com/progptearth.html\n\n    * Two new chapters on the Supercontinent Cycle and on Great Events in Earth history\n\n    * New and updated sections on Earth's thermal history, planetary volcanism, planetary crusts, the onset of plate tectonics, changing composition of the oceans and atmosphere, and paleoclimatic regimes\n\n    * Also new in this Second Edition: the lower mantle and the role of the post-perovskite transition, the role of water in the mantle, new tomographic data tracking plume tails into the deep mantle, Euxinia in Proterozoic oceans, The Hadean, A crustal age gap at 2.4-2.2 Ga, and continental growth\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 578 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 2 edition (August 25, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123852277\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123852274","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82fc167e2f1bc693e9527a222b13851e31f2005c","amp;dn":"Earth+as+an+Evolving+Planetary+System%2C2nd+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82fc167e2f1bc693e9527a222b13851e31f2005c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,252,22,126,47,27,198,147,233,82,122,34,43,19,133,30,49,242,0,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
