If few recognize that distinction, then it's because the Brothers Four were also part of a largely forgotten chapter in the history of folk music in America.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is Collector's Edition ALC 4799CD\nI was not able to find much on the web about this one.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
