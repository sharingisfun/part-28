The group consists of Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitar, vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (percussion, drums).\n\nPart of the post-punk revival movement, The Killers draw influence from music styles of the 1980s and 1990s. The group's debut album, Hot Fuss (2004) brought the band mainstream success. The Killers' second album, Sam's Town, was released in 2006, and the compilation album Sawdust containing B-sides, rarities, and new material, was released in 2007. The band's first two albums have sold in excess of 16 million copies worldwide combined and their third studio album, Day &amp; Age, produced by Stuart Price, was released in November 2008.\n\nLive in Copenhagen 2006.\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2009 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b51c4e7cd18eea4417dd10c59ef54470334e6f","amp;dn":"The+Killers+-+All+These+Things+That+I%5C%27ve+Done+%28Live+Copenhage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b51c4e7cd18eea4417dd10c59ef54470334e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,181,28,78,124,209,142,234,68,23,221,16,197,158,245,68,112,51,78,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
