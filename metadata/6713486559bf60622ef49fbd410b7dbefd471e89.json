First he tries to teach Tanner and Rut how to play football - with an automotive twist. Then he reveals his own concept car designed to protect you against the worst things on the road - other drivers. Finally, he gets behind the wheel of the legendary Ford GT40 and puts a bizarre twist on the classic Le Mans race where Ford beat Ferrari, with an unsuspecting Rutledge at the wheel of the Ferrari.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6713486559bf60622ef49fbd410b7dbefd471e89","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.US.S03E12.720p.HDTV.x264-BALLISTIC.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6713486559bf60622ef49fbd410b7dbefd471e89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,19,72,101,89,191,96,98,46,244,159,189,65,11,125,190,253,71,30,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
