So this is\n\n  - [Ex-uvie] (1998\n  - Satyre cornu (2001)\n  - Maudat (2003)\n  - Nuiet de Sabbat (2011)\n\nNow, our good friend Wikipedia says about themÃ¢â‚¬Â¯: \n\nStille Volk (meaning &quot;The Silent People&quot; in Dutch and German) is a folk band from the Pyrenees area of France. The band formed in 1994, and draws inspiration from Celtic and medieval music.\n\nThe members play mostly, sometimes exclusively, traditional instruments (except on the more experimental album Ex-uvies). The lyrics are usually sung in French, Catalan or Occitan, and are mostly pagan-themed, evoking nature, myths, magical beings and sorcery.\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stille_Volk)\n\nTheir site is at www.stillevolk.org and you should definitely check it out: even if these album are great, they can't stand the comparison to their concerts, which are some of the bests folk music concerts I have ever saw.\n\n\nAlso, these files are freshly ripped, directly in 32 bit FLAC, so you would have a hard time finding a better quality, but that should not be an excuse for not buying the CDs if you liked them, small bands need support. Theirs are available at Holy Records at very decent prices http://www.emp-online.fr/search/stille%20volk/\n\nNow, thanks for reading my boring lecture on moral and supporting artists and blah blah blah. Enjoy your Stille Volk!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26897c13f3a1805dc2493dca176ad230a45690c3","amp;dn":"Stille+Volk+quasi-discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26897c13f3a1805dc2493dca176ad230a45690c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,137,124,19,243,161,128,93,194,73,61,202,23,106,210,48,164,86,144,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
