Let me therefore, with all the vehemence at my command, urge all other music-lovers not to overlook this particular disc, for it features an artist of world class, by any standard, whose playing will certainly impress anyone tempted to regard the guitar as a 'lesser' instrument. (That so few records by him have been issued is indeed extraordinary.) I have rarely heardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on any instrumentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a more clean-cut, firmly rhythmical, tonally sensitive and musically satisfying reading of the Bach ChaconneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and it strikes me as singularly perverse of the sleeve-note merely to quote a Paris critic who in 1935 was outraged by Segovia transcribing it from the violin original. Even he, however, would be hard put to find fault with the Sor variations, especially as played here, with virtuoso brilliance and subtle nuances of phrasing and tone. Both these two works are performed on the normal guitar: for the rest of the programme (in which Sollscher sometimes adds discreet embellishments to the text) he uses an 11-string alto instrument tuned like a Renaissance lute, which allows him to play the pieces without having to transcribe them.\n\nThere are some jewels here: a gem of another kind is provided by the sleeve-note writer who declares the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book to have been compiled by someone who was not even born until a century and a quarter after its actual compilation date of about 1615. The recording, like the performances, is first class.\nLionel Salter Gramophone [9/1984] \n\n------------------- Tracks -----------------------------\n01 Greensleevs Traditional Renaissance 16th century\n\n02 Kemp's Jig Traditional Renaissance\n\n03 Packington's Pound Anonymous Baroque 17th cen England\n\n04 Watkins ale Renaissance ca 1580 England\n\n05 Lachrimae Pavan P 15 John Dowland\n\n06 Frogg Galliard p 23A John Dowland\n\n07 Fantasia for Lute A major Silvius Leopold Weiss\n\n08 Chaconne for Lute A major Silvius Leopold Weiss\n\n09 Parita for Violin no2 D minor BWV1004 JS Bach\n\n10 Variations for Guitar on &quot;Malborough s'en va-t-en-guerre Fernando Sor\n\n11 Primo Libro d'intavolatura di liuto Toccata Michelangelo Galilei\n\n12 Primo Libro d'intavolatura di liuto Corrente Michelangelo Galilei\n\n13 Primo Libro d'intavolatura di liuto Volta Michelangelo Galilei\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3fb84a847c87a74873c2d776425a030679b34e6","amp;dn":"G%C3%83%C2%B6ran+S%C3%83%C2%B6llscher+%28Goran+Sollscher%29+-+Greensleeves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3fb84a847c87a74873c2d776425a030679b34e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,251,132,168,71,200,122,116,135,60,45,119,100,37,160,48,103,155,52,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
