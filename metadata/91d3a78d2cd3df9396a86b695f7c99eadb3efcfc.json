They work on computers, Xbox 360, PS3, WDHD TV, media servers, some blu ray players and some upscaling dvd players.==-\n\n* We believe it is better to test quality with a sample, which we always provide. It's a much better representation of what the release will look like on your TV / monitor.\n\n* Subtitles are provided as often as possible but sometimes the source doesn't include them. If you desperately want subs, there are plenty of places they can be found. Just ensure the run time is the same. \n\n* The occasional cinavia error on the PS3 does not occur on all PS3's. If it happens to you, don't claim it will happen to everyone. \n\n* Yes, our releases ARE 720p. We just don't waste space by encoding the black bars. If you don't understand this, do research on aspect ratio. The source files are the same or proportionate resolution. \n\n* Comments are meant to thank the encoder and discuss the encode, not for unintelligently bashing the movie itself. If you can't say anything useful, move on. Films should be judged on what they are intended to do, not what you want them to do for you. \n\n* In most cases, we do rar our releases. We can't make everyone happy, some prefer rars, some don't. Most seedbox users prefer rars as downloads are much faster. Also, you can seed pieces of an upload without having to download all the files. For quite some time now, all our rars can still be watched using players such as VLC without extraction. This means, you don't have to use up twice the space on your hard drive while seeding if that is a concern. Always try 'keep broken files' on your rar program if something doesn't extract. \n\n* If you have problems extracting files, check your files thoroughly before making any comments claiming it's a bad download. Ask someone else to check also. We test our files properly before sharing them with you. \n\n* Thanks to those who respect and appreciate the work that goes into this process! \n\n================================================================\n\nSource: Hellraiser.IV.Bloodline.1996.720p.BluRay.x264-UNTOUCHABLES\n\n ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 2455M\nPlayTime           : 01:24:44.921\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 1280 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 720 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 23.975fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 106395\nVideoBitRate       : 3397703\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : AC3\nAudioBitRate       : 640000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116514/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116514/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn the 22nd century, a scientist attempts to right the wrong his ancestor created: the puzzle box that opens the gates of Hell and unleashes Pinhead and his Cenobite legions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91d3a78d2cd3df9396a86b695f7c99eadb3efcfc","amp;dn":"Hellraiser+4+Bloodline+1996+BRRip+XvidHD+720p-NPW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91d3a78d2cd3df9396a86b695f7c99eadb3efcfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,211,167,141,44,211,223,147,150,168,107,105,95,124,153,234,219,62,252,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
