This capstone was later divided up by Alexander the Great with one piece in a booby-trapped hidden location within each of the seven wonders of the world, in other than the Pyramid. If and when they are reunited and replaced on the capstone during another solar event, they can bring 1,000 years of peace or power for the nation which possesses them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af3d0b50253468b28bb40b187345b792a284c7d6","amp;dn":"01+-+Seven+Ancient+Wonders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af3d0b50253468b28bb40b187345b792a284c7d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,61,11,80,37,52,104,178,139,180,11,24,115,69,183,146,162,132,199,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
