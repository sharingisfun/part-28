He sees only one way out - money. Raphael meets the monstrous snuff movie maker McCarthy (Marlon Brando); he offers Raphael $30,000 to be the star of one of his movies. He accepts and has $5,000 in his hand, $25,000 to go to his family and just one week in which to live the rest of his life. Determined to make something good out of his last seven days, he builds a junkyard paradise for his family. He relishes his new friendship with his kids and falls in love with his wife all over again. Realising that he is worth more to his family alive than dead, he tries to return the money and end the contract - but is it too late? \n\n-- A very dark but very philosophical movie, my favorite and rare to find.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ccf86f4899f0845abc96df65b042c3d03cf1116","amp;dn":"Johnny+Depp+The+Brave.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ccf86f4899f0845abc96df65b042c3d03cf1116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,207,134,244,137,159,8,69,171,201,109,246,91,4,44,61,3,207,17,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
