And\nwe're offering exactly the same offline functions as the original. With\nours you can even run the game in SAFE mode, unlike your &quot;amazing&quot;\nmethod.\n\nPlease don't claim the endusers are as stupid as monkeys - wait you\njust did with your &quot;proper&quot;!\n\n\n   RELEASE NOTES\n\n\nRead changelog.txt for information on updated content!\n\n\n   INSTALL NOTES\n\n\n1.
