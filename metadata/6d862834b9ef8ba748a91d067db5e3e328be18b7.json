This fixes that.\n\nI have tried this with the SKIDROW release personally, but I did not play or save before fixing so I don't know about any effects to saves.\n\n\nTo apply:\n\nJust copy and paste the stuff from the relevant folder to the installation directory.\n\n\nA bit of the readme:\n\nNO DLCs enabled / no preorder content at all\n\nChangedDLCS folder, has these changes\n\nDisabled bonus $$/respect on start\nDisabled bonus hourly/weekly $\nDisabled other bonus money drop related shit (i think npcs dropped more $ or something).\nDisabled VTOL/SaintsTank etc (VTOL is what instantly takes over areas)\nKept all outfits + homies + weapon packs + preorder packs i could.\n\n\nPlease don't delete this torrent. I swear it's legit and I'm only trying to help out.\n\nI'll try and help with any problems, though I doubt I'll be any help :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d862834b9ef8ba748a91d067db5e3e328be18b7","amp;dn":"Remove+Extra+Unlocks+From+Saints+Row+The+Third+SKIDROW+Release+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d862834b9ef8ba748a91d067db5e3e328be18b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,134,40,52,185,239,139,167,72,169,29,6,125,181,227,227,40,190,24,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
