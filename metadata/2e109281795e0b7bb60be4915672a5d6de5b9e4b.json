But Ronald and Allis Radosh show that the real drama of that era lay in the story of the movie stars, directors and especially screenwriters who joined the Communist Party or traveled in its orbit, and made the Party the focus of their political and social lives. The authors' most controversial discovery is that during the investigations of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Hollywood Reds themselves were beset by doubts and disagreements about their disloyalty to America, and their own treatment by the Communist Party. Abandoned by their old CP allies, they faced the Blacklist alone.\n\n309 pages\nPublisher: Encounter Books; First edition (May 1, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1893554961\nISBN-13: 978-1893554962","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e109281795e0b7bb60be4915672a5d6de5b9e4b","amp;dn":"Red+Star+Over+Hollywood+%282005%29+by+Ronald+Radosh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e109281795e0b7bb60be4915672a5d6de5b9e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,16,146,129,121,94,11,123,182,11,228,145,86,114,165,214,222,91,158,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
