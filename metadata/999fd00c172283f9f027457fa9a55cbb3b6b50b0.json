Unable to face her family in such a condition, Sophie runs away in search of a way to become young again. Along the way, Sophie helps a turnip headed scarecrow, who repays her by leading her to the moving castle owned by the dreaded wizard Howl. There she befriends Howl&amp;#039;s apprentice Markl, Howl&amp;#039;s fire demon Calcifer, and eventually, Howl himself. Sophie then becomes the castle&amp;#039;s cleaning lady in an effort to not only find the solution to her problem but to save Howl from his own terrible secrets as well.&quot;\n\nAudio codec: OGG Vorbis\nVideo codec: Xvid\nContainer: Matroska\nSize: About 1,5GB\nLanguage: Original japanese voices with optional Swedish subs ripped from the DVD.\n\nQuality is almost as good as the original with the same resolution intact. This is about the first torrent I ever made. I really hope it will work. Any feedback is welcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:999fd00c172283f9f027457fa9a55cbb3b6b50b0","amp;dn":"Hauru+no+Ugoku+Shiro+%28Howls+Moving+Castle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"999fd00c172283f9f027457fa9a55cbb3b6b50b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,159,208,12,23,34,131,249,240,39,69,127,169,165,92,187,59,107,80,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
