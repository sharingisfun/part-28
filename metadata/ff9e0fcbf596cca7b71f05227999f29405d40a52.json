But everything changed when Dr. Walker lost his job in the wake of a mysterious incident. Now in dire straits, the family must relocate to an old Victorian house that used to be the home of occult novelist Denver KristoffÃ¢â‚¬â€a house that feels simultaneously creepy and too good to be true.\n\nBy the time the Walkers realize that one of their neighbors has sinister plans for them, they're banished to a primeval forest way off the grid. Their parents? Gone. Their friends? A world away. And they aren't alone. Bloodthirsty medieval warriors patrol the woods around them, supernatural pirates roam the neighboring seas, and a power-hungry queen rules the land. To survive, the siblings will have to be braver than they ever thought possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€and fight against their darkest impulses. The key may lie in their own connection to the secret Kristoff legacy. But as they unravel that legacy, they'll discover it's not just their family that's in danger . . . it's the entire world.\n\nFrom master storytellers Chris Columbus and Ned Vizzini comes this wildly imagi-native fantasy about a family's journey to find its way home.\n\nHailed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a breakneck, jam-packed roller coaster of an adventureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by J. K. Rowling, this New York Times bestseller is the first installment in the explosive tween fantasy series by famed Hollywood director Chris Columbus (of Harry Potter fame) and bestselling author Ned Vizzini (ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kind of a Funny Story).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff9e0fcbf596cca7b71f05227999f29405d40a52","amp;dn":"House+of+Secrets+-+Chris+Columbus+%26amp%3B+Ned+Vizzini.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff9e0fcbf596cca7b71f05227999f29405d40a52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,158,15,203,245,150,204,167,183,31,5,34,121,153,242,148,5,212,10,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
