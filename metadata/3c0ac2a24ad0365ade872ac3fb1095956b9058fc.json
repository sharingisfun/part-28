Helmed by The King's Speech's Academy AwardÃ‚Â®-winning director, Tom Hooper, the Working Title/Cameron Mackintosh production stars Hugh Jackman, Oscar winner Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit, Samantha Barks, with Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. Set against the backdrop of 19th-century France, Les MisÃƒÂ©rables tells an enthralling story of broken dreams and unrequited love, passion, sacrifice and redemption - a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit. Jackman plays ex-prisoner Jean Valjean, hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman Javert (Crowe) after he breaks parole. When Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's (Hathaway) young daughter, Cosette, their lives change forever. In December 2012, the world's longest-running musical brings its power to the big screen in Tom Hooper's sweeping and spectacular interpretation of Victor Hugo's epic tale. With international superstars and beloved songs including I Dreamed a Dream, Bring Him Home, One Day More and On My Own Les MisÃƒÂ©rables, the show of shows, is now reborn as the cinematic musical experience of a lifetime..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Look Down - Hugh Jackman &amp; Russell Crowe &amp; Convicts\n[02] The Bishop - Hugh Jackman &amp; Colm Wilkinson \n[03] Valjean's Soliloquy - Hugh Jackman \n[04] At The End Of The Day - Hugh Jackman &amp; Anne Hathaway &amp; Factory Girls &amp; Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast  \n[05] I Dreamed A Dream - Anne Hathaway  \n[06] The Confrontation - Hugh Jackman &amp; Russell Crowe  \n[07] Castle On A Cloud - Isabelle Allen \n[08] Master Of The House - Sacha Baron Cohen &amp; Helena Bonham Carter &amp; Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast  \n[09] Suddenly - Hugh Jackman  \n[10] Stars -  Russell Crowe \n[11] ABC Cafe - Red And Black - Eddie Redmayne &amp; Aaron Tviet &amp; Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast  \n[12] In My Life - A Heart Full Of Love - Amanda Seyfried &amp; Eddie Redmayne &amp; Samantha Barks  \n[13] On My Own - Samantha Barks \n[14] One Day More - Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast  \n[15] Drink With Me - Eddie Redmayne, Daniel Huttlestone &amp; Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast \n[16] Bring Him Home - Hugh Jackman \n[17] The Final Battle - Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast \n[18] Javert's Suicide - Russell Crowe \n[19] Empty Chairs At Empty Tables - Eddie Redmayne \n[20] Epilogue - Les MisÃƒÂ©rables Cast \n\n\tCD Play Time - 01h:05m:23s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 340mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
