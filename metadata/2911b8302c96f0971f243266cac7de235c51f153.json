The band as it was at the time consisted of Jesper, Johan Larsson and Glenn LjungstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m. A demo was recorded and soon after the band got a record deal and released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLunar StrainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it did not take long before the album was a classic in the fast growing Scandinavian death metal scene. \n\nWith a new line up consisting of Jesper, Johan &amp; Glenn along with two new additions: Anders FridÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n on vocals and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Gelotte on drums, In Flames signed a license deal with Nuclear Blast Records and soon started recording the follow up: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Jester RaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Jester RaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ quickly became a big hit all across Europe and Japan. After the recording of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhoracleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 1997 Johan and Glenn decided to leave the band and Peter Iwers (bass) joined. Niklas Engelin (Gardenian, Engel) was temporarily in the band filling in on guitars. \n\n\n(This is the Reloaded version with 4 bonus tracks)\n\n\nThe songs is ripped with itunes\n\n\nRate  &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;         \n                \nSong List\n1: Moonshield\n2: The Jester Dance\n3: Artifacts Of The Black Rain\n4: Graveland\n5: Lord Hypnos\n6: Dead Eternity\n7: The Jester Race\n8: December Flower\n9: Wayfaerer\n10: Dead God In Me\n11: Goliaths Disarm Their Davids\n12: Gyroscope\n13: Acoustic Medley\n14: Behind Space [Live]\n\nfor more information comment..\n\n\nseed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2911b8302c96f0971f243266cac7de235c51f153","amp;dn":"In+Flames+-+The+Jester+Race+Black+Ash+Inheritance+%28Reloaded%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2911b8302c96f0971f243266cac7de235c51f153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,17,184,48,44,150,240,151,31,36,50,102,202,199,222,35,92,81,241,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
