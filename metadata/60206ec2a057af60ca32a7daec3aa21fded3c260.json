Among the guests weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got blocSonic regulars such as Joey Ripps, Ohbliv and Sleaze. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also got some new names Ã¢â‚¬â€ Black Liquid, Braintrust, Mic Jordan, Gordy Michael, NOTE, Octavion Xcellence, Photosynthesizers and last but not leastÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the INCREDIBLEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Chuck D! ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the legendary Public Enemy front man took time out of his busy schedule to drop a verse!\n\nAs youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll read in AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PDF liner-notes, this album was a long time in the making and has undergone a few changes along the wayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but in my opinion, it was worth itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Ant turned out another fantastic release! I hope youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy it as much as I do.\n\nThanks in advance for checking it out! RememberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ keep the music movingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ blog itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ podcast it!\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection:\n\nArtist/Composer: Anthony Gillison\nDate: 2010-07-27\nKeywords: blocsonic; just plain ant; note; the chevy rydah; black liquid; richmond; virginia; hip-hop; free; music; freemusic; ccmusic; creative commons; flac; ogg; mp3; chuck d; public enemy; new york city; sleaze; joey ripps; ohbliv; octavion xcellence; gordy michael; photosynthesizers; draztiq; mic jordan; braintrust\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007.pdf.zip \tZIP \t8.2 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t73.2 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t103.4 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t103.3 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t17.3 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t20.5 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t264.2 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0007_OGG.zip \tZIP \t99.0 MB\nAudio Files \tVBR MP3 \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3\n01 - Take One (Featuring Joey Ripps) \t3.7 MB\n\t2.0 MB\n\t5.0 MB\n02 - This Is Madness (Just Plain Black) (Featuring Black Liquid) \t4.8 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n\t6.2 MB\n03 - I'm Not Lyin' (Featuring Octavion Xcellence) \t2.7 MB\n\t1.5 MB\n\t4.5 MB\n04 - No Title For It (Featuring Ohbliv and Gordy Michael) \t4.5 MB\n\t2.6 MB\n\t6.6 MB\n05 - I Listen 2 Classical (Featuring Sleaze) \t2.7 MB\n\t1.5 MB\n\t3.9 MB\n06 - Request (Featuring Barcodez and SamSun of Photosynthesizers) \t4.3 MB\n\t2.4 MB\n\t6.1 MB\n07 - Primetime Bandit (Remix) (Featuring Draztiq) \t5.1 MB\n\t2.7 MB\n\t6.7 MB\n08 - Way Back When (Featuring Chuck D) \t2.1 MB\n\t1.2 MB\n\t3.3 MB\n09 - Some People Never Learn (Featuring NOTE) \t3.7 MB\n\t1.8 MB\n\t4.9 MB\n10 - These Times (Featuring Sleaze and Joey Ripps) \t4.1 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n\t6.1 MB\n11 - Out Of Here (Featuring Mic Jordan) \t3.2 MB\n\t1.8 MB\n\t4.5 MB\n12 - Scream Out (Featuring Braintrust) \t5.6 MB\n\t2.8 MB\n\t7.4 MB\nImage Files \tJPEG \tJPEG Thumb\nBSOG0007.jpg \t191.4 KB\n\t4.7 KB\nInformation \tFormat\tSize\nBSOG0007_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file]\nBSOG0007_meta.xml \tMetadata \t2.2 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60206ec2a057af60ca32a7daec3aa21fded3c260","amp;dn":"%5BBSOG0007%5D+Just+Plain+Ant+-+Rumble%2C+Young+Man%2C+Rumble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60206ec2a057af60ca32a7daec3aa21fded3c260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,32,110,194,160,87,175,96,202,50,167,218,236,58,162,31,222,211,194,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
