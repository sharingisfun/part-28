But what the people of Onewere don't know is this: the white elite will stop at nothing to meet their own blood-thirsty needsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhen Maryam crosses from child to woman, she must leave everything she has ever known and make a Crossing of another kind. But life inside the Holy City is not as she had dreamed, and she is faced with the unthinkable: obey the Apostles and very likely die, or turn her back on every belief she once held dear.\n\nThis book is a fast, suspenseful drama underpinned by a powerful and moving story about love and loss.\n\nA compelling dystopian novel; winner of the 2010 New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards: Young Adult Fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:360741b0881cb4bd51cff728303ffb22ff105ea9","amp;dn":"Blood+of+The+Lamb+%5BBook+1%5D+-+The+Crossing+-+Mandy+Hager.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"360741b0881cb4bd51cff728303ffb22ff105ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,7,65,176,136,28,180,189,81,207,247,40,48,63,251,34,255,16,94,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
