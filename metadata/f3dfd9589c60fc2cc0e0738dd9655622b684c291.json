INTO THE WILD GREEN YONDER\nis about as epic as it gets, with the fetchingly cyclopean Leela on the lam from the obnoxious law of Zapp\nBrannigan. Meanwhile, Bender is wrapped up in a love affair with a fembot whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spoken for, leaving Fry with\nthe task of protecting the universe from mysterious dark forces that are older than time itself. So basically,\nthe universe only has a short time left to live. All the more reason not to miss one second of the most exciting\nadventure yet in the saga of FUTURAMA, the critically acclaimed cult-favorite series from some of the brilliant\nminds behind THE SIMPSONS. INTO THE WILD GREEN YONDER features the special guest-star voices of Penn Jillette\nand Snoop Dogg.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3dfd9589c60fc2cc0e0738dd9655622b684c291","amp;dn":"Futurama+Into+The+Wild+Green+Yonder+2009+DVDRip-NoGrp+%28Kvcd+By+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3dfd9589c60fc2cc0e0738dd9655622b684c291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,223,217,88,156,96,252,44,192,224,115,141,217,101,86,34,182,132,194,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
