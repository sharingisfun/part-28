This way, you can easily select the items to edit. \n\nLight Developer offers support for batch processing, which means you can add multiple images to the list and edit them at the same time. \n\nThe program gives users the possibility to rotate, flip, or crop the photos, change the image size, correct the barrel distortion problem, work with multiple layers, and view a history with the recent actions. \n\nOther important features enable users to apply automatic gamma and contrast corrections, adjust the levels for brightness and contrast, change the colors of the photos to black and white, as well as apply various filters for changing the color temperature, saturation, grain, and sharpness levels. \n\nLight Developer also lets you improve photo quality by applying noise reduction, starlight, gradient, or diffuse filters, cut objects from the background, and embed text messages. \n\nAdditionally, you are allowed to rename the images, edit tags, sort the items by name, EXIF data, or last modified date, as well as change the general information in terms or artist, copyright, color space, aperture, shutter and ISO speed, focal length, and others. \n\nWhen it comes to exporting options, you can save the generated items to JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, or PCX. If you opt for saving the items to JPG, then you can set the quality of the photos, change their size, and specify the compression rate. Plus, you can print the photos. \n\nAll things considered, Light Developer is a reliable application that bundles useful features for helping you correct or enhance images in a professional way.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Use serial to register\n- Please manually copy all 8bf files to the photoshop plugin folder.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/45845561916813134071.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/45845561916813134071.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/90284299229606703320.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/90284299229606703320.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbf97b890da385d748e79b6c02ef879d69573d78","amp;dn":"Steght+Developer+7.7+%5BENG%5D+%5BSerial%5D+%5BPhotoshop+Plugin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbf97b890da385d748e79b6c02ef879d69573d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,249,123,137,13,163,133,215,72,231,155,108,2,239,135,157,105,87,61,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
