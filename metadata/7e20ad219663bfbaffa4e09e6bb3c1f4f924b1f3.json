Donne is working (by day) as Chief Secretary to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton, at his Palace in London's Strand. By night, he is living a life of excess in the fleshpots of the city. His famously erotic love poems are unpublished, but widely circulated in literary London.\n\nHowever, the poet has begun to fall in love with his boss' niece Ann More. But Donne comes from a Catholic family, which puts him beyond the pale in decent society.\n\nDuring these heady months in the 'raddled and ribald glamour' of Elizabethan London, Donne's poems are gaining wider currency, including the famous love poem 'The Flea' (memorably described by turn-of-the-century critic Arthur Quiller-Couch as 'the most disgusting in our language'), 'The Sonne Rising', 'To His Mistress Going to Bed', 'Love's Ecstasie'.\n\nCredits\nThe Flea - Toby Jones\nJohn Donne - Conrad Nelson\nAnn - Natalie Grady\nEgerton - Malcolm Raeburn\nBrooke - William Ash\nEssex - William Ash\nSir George - David Fleeshman\nPriest - David Fleeshman\nBeth - Claire Brown\nDirected in Salford by - Susan Roberts\nWriter - Michael Symmons Roberts\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------File Information---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst broadcast: BBC R4 Afternoon Drama 16 Apr 2013\nType: MPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 128 kbps mp3 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 44 khz - Joint Stereo\nDuration: 44 minutes\nCaptured with Radio Downloader, edited with mp3DirectCut\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e20ad219663bfbaffa4e09e6bb3c1f4f924b1f3","amp;dn":"The+Flea+-+Michael+Symmons+Roberts+++%28BBC+Drama+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e20ad219663bfbaffa4e09e6bb3c1f4f924b1f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,32,173,33,150,99,191,186,255,164,224,158,107,179,193,244,249,36,177,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
