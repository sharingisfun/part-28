That means I'm merely 12 albums short of my goal of sharing 1000.  And I've easily got that, and then some, already waiting to be shared in my next bundle.  Which, in all probably hood, may very well be my final bundle of the year unless everyone wants me to try and keep this thing going for a while longer.\n\nThis 38th bundle today includes lots of metal (Becoming The Archetype, I Am King, Imari Tones), the usual amount of hip-hop and rap (Group1Crew, SM Souljah, Urban Soldiers), some gospel (Essential Gospel Classics), rock (Neal Morse, The Icarus Account), blues (Rita Engedalen And Margit Bakken), and even country (Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Cook).  It's got a spanish/english single (Ricky Webber), as well as a french/english compilation album (Dan Ar Braz).  In short, hopefully something for everyone ... And all for God!\n\nSpecifically, the 23 titles in this 38th bundle today include...\n\n * Becoming The Archetype - 2012 - Celestial Progression EP\n * Becoming The Archetype - 2012 - I Am\n * Dan Ar Braz - 2012 - Celebration\n * Elan Brio - 2012 - Show And Tell\n * Elizabeth Cook - 2012 - Snapshot\n * Group1Crew - 2012 - Fearless\n * I Am King - 2012 - I Am King EP\n * I Am King - 2012 - Without Fear - Single\n * Icarus Account, The - 2012 - Carry Me Home\n * Imari Tones - 2012 - Japan Metal Jesus\n * Jared Anderson - 2012 - The Narrow Road\n * Johnny Cash - 2012 - Bootleg, Vol IV - The Soul Of Truth\n * Memphis May Fire - 2012 - Grenade - Single\n * Michael Rosandich - 2012 - Praise Songs\n * Neal Morse - 2012 - Momentum\n * Poema - 2012 - Remembering You\n * Ricky Webber - 2012 - I'm Praying - Single\n * Rita Engedalen And Margit Bakken - 2012 - Women In Blues Broken Soul Blues\n * SiKC - 2012 - They Do - Freestyle - Single\n * SM Souljah - 2012 - Lost Pages\n * Various - 2012 - Essential Gospel Classics\n * Various - 2012 - Urban Soldiers\n * Viktory - 2012 - Unstoppable - Single\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1932ae9d828577e442b0088b5af87df26174d508","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+38+of+38%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1932ae9d828577e442b0088b5af87df26174d508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,50,174,157,130,133,119,228,66,176,8,139,90,248,125,242,97,116,213,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
