His Newman Center focuses on being fed through the Sacraments as well as study and knowledge of the Church and has thrived under his humble and Spirit-filled guidance. Through these three homilies filled with deep reflection on the Scriptures and vibrant stories, Fr. Mike makes sure you will never experience the Mass in the same way again.\n\nFiletype: MP3\nLength: 01:12:10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/true-worship&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/true-worship&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
