Their first for Reprise, this witty songbook finds the Canadian five-piece to be a clever group -- charming, but not childish, yet the Barenaked Ladies are pretty close to overstepping the boundaries of silliness. The thing that keeps them in line is their sharp harmonies. Shared vocals between guitarist Ed Robertson and Steven Page are refreshing and upbeat, especially on reworked versions of &quot;Brian Wilson,&quot; &quot;Be My Yoko Ono,&quot; and the eternal favorite &quot;If I Had a $1000000 Dollars.&quot; &quot;Hello City&quot; and &quot;Box Set&quot; are slick narratives, making for album standouts with its jazz-cool blend. Other shiny moments, such as &quot;Enid&quot; and &quot;Grade 9,&quot; are humorous in reflecting upon adolescence, while &quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me&quot; showcases the Barenaked Ladies' more romantic side. Through all the jokes, these guys are a bunch of suckers for love and such sensitivity is a great match for their quirky musical persona. Gordon is a great introduction to the Barenaked Ladies' sweet comic relief and it's sure to be a college rock mainstay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91071c54c95de6f94b4da26adfd4f5752aaa5597","amp;dn":"Barenaked+Ladies+-+Gordon+%5B1992%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91071c54c95de6f94b4da26adfd4f5752aaa5597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,7,28,84,201,93,230,249,75,77,162,106,223,212,245,117,42,170,85,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
