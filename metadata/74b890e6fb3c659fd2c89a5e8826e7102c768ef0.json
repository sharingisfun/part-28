It is regarded by many as his magnum opus. With worldwide sales of at least 16 million it is his best selling studio album. In 2000 Q magazine placed it at number 84 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 91 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n \nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road was recorded at the Chateau d'Herouville, where John had previously recorded Honky ChÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢teau and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. The amount of material was such that Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was released as a double album, his first. This album had originally been planned to be recorded in Jamaica, since The Rolling Stones had recorded Goats Head Soup there. Technical difficulties, coupled with political unrest in the country at the time, forced the band to make an early departure without any productive work getting done.[1]\n \nIn addition to the three successful singles released from this album (see below), many other cuts received substantial airplay at AOR stations when it was released, including &quot;Harmony&quot;; the 11-minute epic, &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;; and his Marilyn Monroe tribute, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;.\n \nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin\n \nSide one\n&quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot; - 11:09 \n&quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; - 3:49 \n&quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; - 5:23\n \nSide two\n&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; - 3:13 \n&quot;This Song Has No Title&quot; - 2:23 \n&quot;Grey Seal&quot; - 4:00 \n&quot;Jamaica Jerk-Off&quot; - 3:38 \n&quot;I've Seen That Movie Too&quot; - 5:58\n \nSide three\n&quot;Sweet Painted Lady&quot; - 3:54 \n&quot;The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)&quot; - 4:23 \n&quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot; - 5:01 \n&quot;All the Girls Love Alice&quot; - 5:09\n \nSide four\n&quot;Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock n' Roll)&quot; - 2:42 \n&quot;Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting&quot; - 4:53 \n&quot;Roy Rogers&quot; - 4:08 \n&quot;Social Disease&quot; - 3:43 \n&quot;Harmony&quot; - 2:46\n \n\n\nTechnical Information\nGoldring 1042GX reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nWavelab 5 recording software\n \nTT - Belari - Laptop - Wavelab 5.01 (24/96) - manual click removal - analyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) - split into individual Tracks - FLAC encoded (Vers. 1.21)\n \nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original tracklayout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b890e6fb3c659fd2c89a5e8826e7102c768ef0","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road+%5BVinyl-180g%5D-aksman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b890e6fb3c659fd2c89a5e8826e7102c768ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,184,144,230,251,60,101,159,210,200,154,94,136,38,231,16,44,118,142,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
