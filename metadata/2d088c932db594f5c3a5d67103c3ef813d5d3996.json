Gwen (Nia Roberts) and Rhys (Matthew Gravelle) are a couple from Cardiff whose relationship is going through a rough patch; her career as an actress is in a slump, so when he gets an assignment to do a photo essay on the Welsh community in Patagonia, she tags along as an assistant. While Gwen and Rhys are hoping the working holiday with help kick-start their marriage, things take a turn for the worse when she becomes infatuated with Mateo (Matthew Rhys), a handsome local man working as their driver. Meanwhile, Alejandro (Nahuel Perez Biscayart) grudgingly agrees to accompany his elderly aunt Cerys (Marta Lubos) as she leaves her small village to have needed surgery, but he soon discovers she actually has other plans, and is instead flying to Wales to see the land her late mother once called home.
