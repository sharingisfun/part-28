It wasn't just their crushingly loud interpretation of the blues -- it was how they incorporated mythology, mysticism, and a variety of other genres (most notably world music and British folk) -- into their sound. Led Zeppelin had mystique. They rarely gave interviews, since the music press detested the band. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. More than any other band, Led Zeppelin established the concept of album-oriented rock, refusing to release popular songs from their albums as singles. In doing so, they established the dominant format for heavy metal, as well as the genre's actual sound. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\nCatalog:\t\t8122797109\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.92% CDDA &amp; 99.93% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Black Dog\n02.Custard Pie\n03.Immigrant Song\n04.Whole Lotta Love\n05.Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\n06.For Your Life\n07.Rock And Roll\n08.What Is And What Should Never Be\n09.Down By The Seaside\n10.I Can't Quit You Baby\n11.Since I've Been Loving You\n12.Stairway To Heaven\n13.Thank You\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Walter's Walk\n02.Heartbreaker\n03.Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman)\n04.Out On The Tiles\n05.Trampled Under Foot\n06.All My Love\n07.D'yer Mak'er\n08.Gallows Pole\n09.Kashmir\n10.Communication Breakdown\n11.I'm Gonna Crawl\n12.I Can't Quit You Baby\n13.The Ocean\n14.Sick Again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d46def9e4a87406d7772314d9a6a3a14018baf36","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+The+Essential+2CD+%5BRemastered%5D+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d46def9e4a87406d7772314d9a6a3a14018baf36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,109,239,158,74,135,64,109,119,114,49,77,154,106,58,20,1,139,175,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
