The first three titles were originally branded overseas under the â€œFINAL FANTASY LEGENDâ€ moniker , and garnered critical acclaim for their complex yet compelling combat system.\r\n\r\nRomancing SaGa 2 takes the varied gameplay of other entries in the series and combines it with an open-ended free-form scenario system whose story is as vast as the world in which it plays out. The player takes the role of a succession of emperors, painting the history of the world with each and every action.\r\n\r\nFamiliar series hallmarks such as formations and glimmers make a return in this unique title.\r\n\r\nStory\r\n\r\nIt all begins with the song of a lone bard in a bustling pub.\r\n\r\nGreat nations such as the Varennes Empire, which had once ensured peace throughout the world, stagnated and atrophied over the course of centuries, and sinister forces started emerging in outlying areas.\r\n\r\nEre long, peace spiraled into war and the common folk spoke in hushed words of the Seven Heroesâ€”historical figures who saved the world once and who, it was hoped, would do so again.\r\n\r\nAdditional Elements\r\n\r\nNew dungeons\r\nNew classes: diviner and ninja\r\nNew Game+\r\nAutosave\r\nUI specifically designed for smartphones\r\n\r\nAndroid 4.2.2 or above recommended.\r\nNot compatible with all devices.\r\n\r\nThis app has no advertisements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad3131f48321869eaf54a28e8c36d1a61099188","amp;dn":"Romancing+SaGa+2+v1.00+%2B+%28Mod+Money%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad3131f48321869eaf54a28e8c36d1a61099188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,211,19,31,72,50,24,105,234,245,74,40,232,195,109,26,97,9,145,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
