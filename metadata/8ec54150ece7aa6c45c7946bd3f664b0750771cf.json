This release 2011 on the Universal Analogue Productions hybrid SACD.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nOne of the underrated gems of the 1960s, an exciting matchup by tenors Sonny Stitt and Paul Gonsalves. Other than the brief throwaway &quot;Theme from Lord of the Flies&quot; (producer Bob Thiele's idea), this is very much a jam session set, with &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; being a heated medium-tempo blues and the two competitive tenors stretching out on &quot;S'posin'&quot; and a lengthy &quot;Perdido.&quot; Actually, the most memorable selection from the date is the one on which Stitt switches to alto, &quot;Stardust.&quot; His beautiful playing behind Gonsalves' warm melody statement raises the session to the classic level. Highly recommended to bebop and straight-ahead jazz fans.\n\nSonny Stitt - Tenor &amp; Alto\nPaul Gonsalves - Tenor\nHank Jones - Piano\nMilt Hinton - Bass\nOsie Johnson - Drums \n\n01.
