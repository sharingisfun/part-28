How We Invented the World looks at the four inventions that have had the most influence on the way we live now: mobile phones, skyscrapers, cars and aeroplanes. Each of these was not a thing in itself, created from nothing; but a series of connections, separate discoveries that came together to form the final product. Take the car: Henry Ford's adoption of the assembly line; Dunlop's invention of the pneumatic tyre and William Burton's extraction of gasoline from oil. We examine these connections and the people who made them possible.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Skyscrapers \nThe skyscraper - the ultimate symbol of power and wealth. But, incredibly, to invent the skyscraper it took a bird in a cage, a city in flames, a chance question from a college student and the humble horse and wagon.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2118 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.discoveryuk.com/web/how-we-invented-the-world/about/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e58b4f48fda626c56d45269f65d02f69eb6967","amp;dn":"Discovery.Ch.How.We.Invented.the.World.2of4.Skyscrapers.Phones.P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e58b4f48fda626c56d45269f65d02f69eb6967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,229,139,79,72,253,166,38,197,109,69,38,159,101,208,47,105,235,105,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
