But this is just all round awesome Metal Hurlant madness by the under appreciated Alain Voss and much worth looking at. Perhaps someone could fix a scanlation?\n\nAlain Voss, or Al Voss, was a French artist, born in Brazil. He published his first work in the 1960s in Brazilian publications like O Loco (Editora Taika) and O Careca. He moved to France in 1972, where he was present in MÃƒÂ©tal Hurlant with comics like 'Heilman', 'Tobiaze' and a series of parodies called 'Parodies de Al Voss'. These persiflages on famous comic heroes like 'Popeye', 'Asterix', 'The Smurfs', 'Blueberry' and 'Superman' were collected in albums by Les HumanoÃƒÂ¯des AssociÃƒÂ©s. Voss was also sporadically present in Charlie Mensuel and Mormoil.\n\nBack in Brazil in 1981, he contributed to Inter-Quadrinhos (Editora Ondas) and Monga, a Mulher Gorila (Press-Maciota). He has also done promotional and advertising assignments, as well as album covers for the Brazilian band Os Mutantes. Voss spent his final years in Portugal, where he has created paintings, illustrated books and album covers. Although he suffered from a stroke in 2009, he collaborated with the Brazilian edition of Le Monde Diplomatique, produced the comic 'Anarcity' on the computer and made the strip 'Os Zensetos' for Caros Amigos. Alain Voss passed away after a second stroke in May 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0323722f41c5f2d93caf8bab12fae193d6635b1a","amp;dn":"Alain+Voss%3A+Lalber+Degli+Spinel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0323722f41c5f2d93caf8bab12fae193d6635b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,35,114,47,65,197,242,217,60,175,139,171,18,250,225,147,214,99,91,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
