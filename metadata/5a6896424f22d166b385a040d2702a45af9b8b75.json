The handful of survivors in London are developing strange, fantastic powers. Evolving. Meanwhile, the Choppers treat the ruined city as their own experimental playground. Jack's own developing powers are startling and frightening, though he is determined to save his father, the brutal man with a horrific power who calls himself Reaper. Jack must also find their friend Lucy-Anne, who went north to find her brother. \n\nWhat Lucy-Anne discovers is terrifying-people evolving into monstrous things and the knowledge that a nuclear bomb has been set to destroy what's left of London. And the clock is ticking.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6896424f22d166b385a040d2702a45af9b8b75","amp;dn":"Reaper%27s+Legacy+-+Tim+Lebbon.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6896424f22d166b385a040d2702a45af9b8b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,104,150,66,79,34,209,102,179,133,160,64,210,112,42,69,175,155,139,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
