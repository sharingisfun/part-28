Cabela's adds an extra edge with a storyline from one of the writers of Fringe. After losing their father to the claws of a grizzly bear, two brothers reunite for a hunt ten years later, putting their past in the crosshairs and their own lives on the line. Track predators that move in coordinated packs, use social hierarchies, and ambush you with behavior driven by a smarter and deadlier AI engine. Things get really hairy in the new split-screen co-op Maneater Mode, where increasingly threatening animals come at you in waves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6be1ec1a4e8bc2182aea3a9ddae37848dadee52","amp;dn":"SUVE52+-+Cabela%27s+Dangerous+Hunts+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6be1ec1a4e8bc2182aea3a9ddae37848dadee52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,190,30,193,164,232,188,33,130,174,163,169,221,174,55,132,141,173,238,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
