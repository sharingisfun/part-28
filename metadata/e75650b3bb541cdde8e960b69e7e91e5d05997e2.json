Players using this tactic were difficult to counterattack in many situations. This change should limit the effectiveness of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfloaty gameplayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and help keep things even for all players.\nSword Side Air, Sword Neutral Air, Sword Down Air, Sword Recovery, Lance Neutral Air, Hammer Side Air, Spear Neutral Air, Spear Side Air, Axe Recovery: Can no longer jump during Recover Time.\n\nUnarmed\nUnarmed has swung back and forth between too good and too situational. Despite previous adjustments, comboing out of the Down Ground continued to dominate Unarmed play. These changes make the kit less capable of building up damage, but better for contesting weapon drops and creating space.\nUnarmed Down Ground: Decreased Stun Time; Reduced Recover Time on miss.\nUnarmed Down Heavy: Rehitboxed to better match animation.\nUnarmed Neutral Air: Reduced Hitbox Size; Reduced Damage; Added a short Cooldown Time; Increased Recover Time on miss; Increased Stun Time; Increased Minimum Force; Decreased Force Scaling.\nUnarmed Neutral Ground: Rehitboxed to better match animation; Extended Hit Window; Slightly increased Recover Time on miss; Reduced Damage.\nUnarmed Side Ground: Increased Force; Increased distance traveled; Decreased Time to Hit; Slightly decreased Recover Time; Added a short Cooldown Time; Extended Hit Window.\n\nBlasters/Katars\nBlasters and Katars see only minor balance changes this patch, but should more reliably complete their multi-hit attacks, especially the notorious Blasters Recovery.\nBlasters Down Air: Fixed a number of cases where the final shots would miss a hit target.\nBlasters Neutral Ground: Fixed some cases where the final shots would miss a hit target.\nBlasters Recovery: Hitboxes now have a uniform height and width; All hitboxes are centered on the same vertical line; Increased final hitbox size; Direction of Force is more predictable; Brought the pistol whip closer to the body to help prevent people from unintentionally falling out.\nBlasters Side Air: Slightly increased Time to Hit.\nKatar Neutral Ground: Fixed some cases where targets could be dropped before the final hit.\n\nLance/Hammer/Sword\nLance and Hammer have gotten changes to their combo setup powers to bring them more in line with the Unarmed and Sword Down Grounds. Combo setups across the board are a bit weaker this patch.\nLance Side Ground: Increased Recover Time on miss; Slightly decreased Recover Time on hit; Slightly increased Force.\nHammer Down Ground: Reduced Hitbox sizes, especially height behind self; Cannot move or jump during Recover Time on miss; Increased Cooldown Time; Increased Force scaling.\nSword Down Ground: Decreased Stun Time; Increased Force; Reduced Damage.\n\nSpear\nThe Spear has become a little too reliant on its Recover and Ground Pound. We've reduced their priority slightly while bringing up the Spear elsewhere with a faster Down Ground. This should add to diversity of play in the Spear game.\nSpear Down Ground: Increased Force scaling; Decreased minimum Force; Decreased Time to Hit; Sped up the ascent; Pushed Hitboxes further above Hurtbox; Decreased Damage. \nSpear Recovery: Decreased Hitbox height and moved closer to Hurtbox; Increased Recover Time.\nSpear Ground Pound: Decreased Hitbox height and moved closer to Hurtbox; Increased Recover Time.\n\nSignatures\nNow that all signature moves have been implemented weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been able to look at them across the board and better understand how theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re impacting each legend and the overall balance of the game. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll continue to adjust as needed in the future, but these changes address a number of imbalances weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve identified so far.\n\nAda\nAda has needed some love. With recent changes to movement damaging her old keep away style of play, she needed some improvements in other areas to allow her to stand toe-to-toe with other legends. These changes should let her get satisfying punishes off more easily and allow for more follow up options.\nAda Neutral Blasters: Ground hits should push the target into a final hit; Increased Force.\nAda Side Blasters: Decreased Recover Time; Sped up power; Slightly Decreased Time to Hit; Fixed a case where hit targets could be lost before the final shot.\nAda Side Spear: Slightly decreased Recover Time; Slightly decreased Time to Hit.\n\nCassidy\nAs one of our fastest-attacking Legends, Cassidy can be very difficult to punish. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made it a little easier to retaliate against her most rewarding signatures.\nCassidy Side Blasters: Slightly decreased Force; Slightly increased Recover Time.\nCassidy Down Hammer: Increased Recover Time.\n\nHattori\nWith the changes to move speed, and STR taking hit priority over DEX, everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite ninja has been in a tough spot. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve adjusted HattoriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signatures slightly to improve her mobility, speed, and ability to stick to her opponent.\nHattori Neutral Sword: Increased Damage; Slightly decreased Force.\nHattori Side Sword: Slightly increased distance traveled.\nHattori Neutral Spear: Teleport occurs faster, with a shorter pause between appearing and attacking.\nHattori Side Spear: Increased Stun Time.\n\nLucien\nWhile we love LucienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new signatures, his original two needed a bit more adjusting to prevent them from being too effective.\nLucien Side Blasters: Increased Time to Hit; Decreased Force; Increased Cooldown Time.\nLucien Side Katar: Slightly increased Time to Hit; Slightly decreased Force.\n\nNai\nQueen Nai has continued to hold a dominating winrate at all ranks. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve left some more space for evading and punishing her strongest signatures. These changes keep Queen NaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playstyle intact, while making poor use of her signatures more punishable.\nNai Down Katar: Decreased Hitbox Height; Increased Recover Time.\nNai Neutral Spear: Slightly increased Recover and Cooldown Time.\nNai Side Spear: Decreased Hitbox size; Slightly increased Recover Time and Time to Hit.\n\nOrion\nWhile OrionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign of terror in the lower ranks is over, his new signatures are holding him back more than intended. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re giving him slight increases across the board so he can keep up with his peers.\nOrion Down Lance: Decreased Time to Hit; Sped up power; Decreased Recover Time; Increased Stun Time; Force is directed more upwards.\nOrion Neutral Lance: Decreased Time to Hit; Increased Hit Window.\nOrion Side Lance: Decreased Time to Hit; Increased distance traveled; Increased Force.\nOrion Down Spear: Increased Damage.\nOrion Neutral Spear: Fixed some cases where the second hit would fail to combo correctly; Will now travel back down through any soft platforms above its starting position.\nOrion Side Spear: Decreased Time to Hit.\n\nand more... view here full changelog here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75650b3bb541cdde8e960b69e7e91e5d05997e2","amp;dn":"Brawlhalla.Beta.v1.13.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75650b3bb541cdde8e960b69e7e91e5d05997e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,86,80,179,187,84,28,221,232,233,96,182,158,126,145,229,208,89,151,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
