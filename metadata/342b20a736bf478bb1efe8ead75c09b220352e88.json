At 66, he still has the voice of an angel and a seemingly inexhaustible fund of wonderful melodies - 'Lazy Afternoon' is particularly delightful. He's no slouch on the guitar either. As well as the new material there are interesting reworkings of some older songs and Anne Dudley's string arrangements are very fine indeed.\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nJustin Hayward - Spirits of the Western Sky 2013\n(Eagle Rock)\n\n     1.
