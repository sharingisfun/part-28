While manager for Irving and secretary and director of London's Lyceum Theatre, he began writing novels, beginning with The Snake's Pass in 1890 and Dracula in 1897. During this period, Stoker was part of the literary staff of the The Daily Telegraph in London, and wrote other fiction, including the horror novels The Lady of the Shroud (1909) and The Lair of the White Worm (1911).[6] In 1906, after Irving's death, he published his life of Irving, which proved successful,[3] and managed productions at the Prince of Wales Theatre.\n\n Before writing Dracula, Stoker met Ãƒï¿½rmin VÃƒÂ¡mbÃƒÂ©ry who was a Hungarian writer and traveler. Dracula likely emerged from VÃƒÂ¡mbÃƒÂ©ry's dark stories of the Carpathian mountains. Stoker then spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of vampires. Dracula is an epistolary novel, written as a collection of realistic, but completely fictional, diary entries, telegrams, letters, ship's logs, and newspaper clippings, all of which added a level of detailed realism to his story, a skill he developed as a newspaper writer. At the time of its publication, Dracula was considered a &quot;straightforward horror novel&quot; based on imaginary creations of supernatural life. &quot;It gave form to a universal fantasy . . . and became a part of popular culture.&quot;\n\n According to the Encyclopedia of World Biography, Stoker's stories are today included within the categories of &quot;horror fiction,&quot; &quot;romanticized Gothic&quot; stories, and &quot;melodrama.&quot;\n\n On the 8 November 2012, Stoker was honoured with a Google Doodle on Google's homepage commemorating his 165th Birthday.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d100962eb8d0d431a25c23b6c79beb04aa4fc3c7","amp;dn":"Bram+Stoker+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d100962eb8d0d431a25c23b6c79beb04aa4fc3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,0,150,46,184,208,212,49,162,92,35,182,199,155,235,4,170,79,195,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
