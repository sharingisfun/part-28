Stoker tells the story of the voyage in only five short pages of the Captain&amp;#039;s log, which becomes increasingly disjointed and garbled, as though the Captain had been seized by some kind of mania. This dark, gothic play imagines the full story of the Demeter&amp;#039;s nightmare voyage.\n\nWhen the play begins, the Demeter is already a troubled ship - two men have mysteriously disappeared - and, as the voyage continues, more men vanish.\n\nThere are reports of a stranger, a tall, pale gentleman, having been seen on deck at night. When the ship finally reaches port, only one man is found on board: the Captain. His hands bound to the wheel and clutching a crucifix, he is already dead as the ship comes into harbour.\n\nRipelski ...... Finlay Welsh\nRobash ...... Gary Lewis\nKanesky ...... Steven McNicoll\nBretov ...... Grant O&amp;#039;Rourke\nGentleman ...... Alexander Morton\n\nProducer Patrick Rayner.\n\n1 Hour.\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Radio Four, 23rd Feb 2008.\n\nMy recording at 160kbps CBR joint-stereo mp3.\n\nFreeview -&gt; DVD Recorder -&gt; MP3.\n\nSee also my torrents of,\n\nDracula by Bram Stoker\n\nSherlock Holmes vs Dracula by Loren D.
