In 1949, J. Mayo Williams, owner of the small Harlem label, offloaded his unsold stock of Stick's 1947 recording 'Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee' to a distributor in New Orleans, where it became a local hit. Atlantic Records saw a gap in the market, and remade version reached #3 in the charts. For the rest of his recording career, McGhee tried to repeat the success of 'Drinkin' Wine' while putting its lyrics into practice.\nThe British Ace label - long a prime source for quality compilations - has done Brownie's little brother proud, collecting his dozen 1953-1955 jump blues sides for the King logo, many of them detailing the effects of booze. Also aboard are four country blues-styled numbers by Ralph Willis, and four more by the pseudonymous Big Tom Collins (two of them feature Brownie McGhee's vocals, the other pair Champion Jack Dupree!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6f8f63ff61ce111148bbae2fbc9f68c0da45990","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Stick+McGhee+-+New+York+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6f8f63ff61ce111148bbae2fbc9f68c0da45990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,248,246,63,246,28,225,17,20,139,186,226,251,201,246,140,13,164,89,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
