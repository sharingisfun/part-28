It has the Sam Hamm draft from 1989.  The draft by Alex Tse and a draft by David Hayter.  I&amp;#039;m not sure which draft they are using because on IMDB it says written by Tse and Hayter.  \n\nWhen an ex-superhero is murdered, a vigilante named Rorshach begins an investigation into the murder, which begins to lead to a much more terrifying conclusion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a3d48254b5f49e0812f9f2f7b9a4186e621044","amp;dn":"Watchmen.Script.Screenplay.Tse.Hayter.Hamm.2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a3d48254b5f49e0812f9f2f7b9a4186e621044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,163,212,130,84,181,244,158,8,18,249,242,247,185,164,24,110,98,16,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
