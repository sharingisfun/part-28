But it's not for lack of trying. In fact, Aerosmith tries too hard, making a stab at social commentary (&quot;Livin' on the Edge&quot;) while keeping adolescent fans in their corner with their trademark raunch-rock (&quot;Get a Grip&quot; and &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;), as well as having radio-ready hit ballads (&quot;Cryin',&quot; &quot;Amazing,&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;). The problem is, it's a studied performance -- it sounds like what an Aerosmith album should sound like. Most of the album sounds good; it's just that there isn't much beneath the surface. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Intro [00:24] \n 02.Eat the rich [04:11] \n 03.Get A grip [03:58] \n 04.Fever [04:15] \n 05.Livin' on the edge [06:07] \n 06.Flesh [05:57] \n 07.Walk on down [03:39] \n 08.Shut up and dance [04:56] \n\n\n 09.Cryin' [05:09] \n 10.Gotta love it [05:58] \n 11.Crazy [05:17] \n 12.Line up [04:03] \n 13.Amazing [05:56] \n 14.Boogie man [02:17] \n ____ \n \n 62:07 min \n 102,10 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98ae9b4f1e2c19183a60fefb2e94c8257fbacb4","amp;dn":"Aerosmith-Get_A_Grip-%28Retail%29-1993-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98ae9b4f1e2c19183a60fefb2e94c8257fbacb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,138,233,180,241,226,193,145,131,166,15,239,178,233,76,130,87,251,172,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
