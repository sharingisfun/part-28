When Britain entered the war, two-thirds of all Britain's food was imported - and now it was under threat from a Nazi blockade. To save Britain from starvation, the nation's farmers were tasked with doubling food production in what Churchill called 'the frontline of freedom'. This meant ploughing up 6.5 million acres of unused land - a combined area bigger than the whole of Wales.\nDue to audio problems with the last upload of this release , i have re-done it from the DVD , SO THIS IS A NEW UPLOAD\n\n\n\n3)  Part 3 \nThe Blitz resulted in one of the biggest mass movements of people in British history as three million city dwellers fled to the countryside. To make outbuildings habitable as refugee shelters, Alex and Peter resort to the age-old craft of making tiles by hand - which means camping out for two days and nights in freezing cold to tend the tile-making kiln. They are visited by a 94-year-old conscientious objector who was conscripted as a farm labourer because he refused to fight on religious grounds. Ruth gets involved in the work of the Royal Observer Corps, who often enlisted farmers in the work of spotting enemy planes. Alex and Peter also learn how to set up 'decoy fires' to lure German bombers off target, a project known as Operation Starfish. With December approaching, the team look forward to celebrating Christmas 1940-style. People were understandably eager to put the horrors of war behind them - if only for a day - but this was the first Christmas under rationing and compromises had to be made. Alex looks at government solutions to the national 'toy shortage', whilst Peter discovers that soap had become the nation's favourite Christmas gift. With turkeys few and far between, Ruth cooks up an alternative - known as 'mock turkey' or 'murkey' - made from apples, onion and a dash of sausage meat, with a pair of parsnips for legs\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1578 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ae6144eb478a5e42d348b458af2fc423f6bdeef","amp;dn":"BBC+Wartime+Farm+3of8+DVDrip+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ae6144eb478a5e42d348b458af2fc423f6bdeef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,230,20,78,180,120,165,228,45,52,139,69,138,242,252,66,63,107,222,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
