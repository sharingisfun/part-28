With artwork by Chris Weston and Gary Erskine, It followed the adventures of Officer Slade, an agent for an inter-reality agency known as the Hand. The first issue showed Slade hiding out from the Hand in a para-personality of Greg Freely, only to be tracked down by ex-colleague Nil and forced to return to duty. With highly designed covers by Segura Inc., &quot;The Filth&quot; pushed the boundaries of storytelling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fca7eefb4d05563ecd5284b444d3d9c69a717dd","amp;dn":"The+Filth+%282004%29+%28TPB%29+%28digital-Empire%29.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fca7eefb4d05563ecd5284b444d3d9c69a717dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,202,126,239,180,208,85,99,236,213,40,75,68,77,61,156,105,167,23,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
