They were known as the Old Man's unit - the most savage section in the whole German army. They were seasoned front-liners - veterans of the trenches.

When their water rations ran out, they came close to madness from thirst in the blistering hell which surrounded them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664d21185f78fd6306180cab9b922674d397d5f5","amp;dn":"The+Bloody+Road+to+Death+-+Hassel+Sven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664d21185f78fd6306180cab9b922674d397d5f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,77,33,24,95,120,253,99,6,24,12,171,155,146,38,116,211,151,213,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
