This book provides an assessment of some issues influencing the characteristics and performance of the microemulsions, as well as their main types of applications. In chapter 1 a short introduction about the background, various aspects and applications of microemulsions is given. In Part 2 some experimental and modeling investigations on microstructure and phase behavior of these systems have been discussed. The last two parts of book is devoted to discussion on different types of microemulsion's applications, namely, use in drug delivery, vaccines, oil industry, preparation of nanostructured polymeric, metallic and metal oxides materials for different applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef60d2c5bdb06ce2fb28f8f74c574f3085a19c6e","amp;dn":"Microemulsions+-+An+Introduction+to+Properties+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef60d2c5bdb06ce2fb28f8f74c574f3085a19c6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,96,210,197,189,176,108,226,251,40,248,247,76,87,79,48,133,161,156,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
