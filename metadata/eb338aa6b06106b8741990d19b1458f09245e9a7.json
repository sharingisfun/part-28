It is said, 'He has a good Aqeedah' meaning,' He is protected from doubts.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nAqeedah is an action of the heart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which is to believe and affirm something in the heart.\n\n&quot;The Sharee'ah is divided into two parts; Beliefs and Actions.\n\n(a) Beliefs are issues that are not related to how an act is performed such as belief in the Lordship of Allah, the obligation to worship Allah (alone) and belief in the other afore-mentioned pillars of Eeman (faith). These are called Asliyah - the basic foundation.\n\n(b) The latter part consists of issues related to how actions are performed like Salaat (prayer), Zakaat (charity), Sawm (fasting) and other rulings with regards to actions. These are termed as Far'eyyah - the branches, because their soundness or corruption is based upon the beliefs.\n\nThe correct Aqeedah is thus the foundation upon which the religion is based. It is the correct Aqeedah with which the actions are set aright as the Most High said, &quot;So, whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&quot; [Soorah al-Kahf (18): 110]\n\n&quot;Indeed, it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam) as it was to those (Prophets) before you, 'If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.&quot; [Soorah az-Zumar (39): 65]\n\n&quot;So, worship Allah (alone) by performing religious deeds sincerely for His sake. Surely, the religion is for Allah only.&quot; [Soorah Zumar (39): 2]\n\nThese verses and numerous other narrations that have been related in this regard confirm that actions are not accepted unless they are free from Shirk (polytheism/associating partners with Allah).\n\nIt was therefore the main concern of the Messengers (alaihimus-salaam) to rectify the beliefs first.\n\nSole worship of Allah and abandonment of worship to anything other than Him was their primary call as the Most High says, &quot;Verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming), 'Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid the Taghoot (everything that is worshiped other than Allah).&quot; [Soorah An-Nahl (16): 36]\n\nThe first issue addressed by every Prophet was, &quot;Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah (deity worthy of being worshiped) but Him.&quot; [Soorah al-A'raf (7): 59, 65, 73, 85]\n\nIt was said by Nuh, Hood, Saleh, Suhaib (alaihimus-salaam) and all the other Prophets (alaihimus-salaam) to their nations. After being bestowed with Prophethood, the Messenger of Allah (sallallahi alaihi wa-sallam) stayed in Mecca for thirteen years calling people to Tawheed and rectifying their Aqeedah because Aqeedah is the foundation upon which the entire structure of the Deen stands.\n\nThe Duaat (callers to the religion of Allah) and those who seek to guide others during every age followed the example of the Messengers and the Prophets who initiated their call with Tawheed (Oneness of AllahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worship) and correction of Aqeedah, and subsequently focusing upon the remaining commandments of the Deen (religion).&quot;\n\n..........................................................................................\n\nThis book comprehensively explains Tawheed in the words of Shaikh ibn Saleh al-Uthaimeen (rahimahullah) from the book, 'Sharh Hadeeth Jibra'eel'.\n\nAppendix adapted from the book, 'Aqeedah at-Tawheed' by Shaikh Saleh ibn Fawzan ibn Abdullah al-Fawzan (hafidhhullah)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb338aa6b06106b8741990d19b1458f09245e9a7","amp;dn":"What+you+must+Believe+about+your+Creator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb338aa6b06106b8741990d19b1458f09245e9a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,51,138,166,176,97,6,184,116,25,144,209,155,20,88,240,146,69,233,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
