It provides the necessary foundations both for those wishing to learn about this methodology and also for those who have a need to apply it in their work. Illustrative examples are drawn from projects formulated within the domains of both discrete-event dynamic systems and continuous-time dynamic systems.\n\nTopics and features: presents a project-oriented (i.e., goal-based) perspective on modelling and simulation; describes an updated novel activity based conceptual modelling framework (the ABCmod framework) for discrete-event dynamic systems; includes a new chapter that presents a novel world view, the Activity-Object world view, which eases the translation of a conceptual model specification in the ABCmod framework into a simulation program; contains numerous illustrative examples and useful algorithms, in addition to exercises and projects at the end of most chapters; includes a primer on probability, a concise guide to the GPSS programming environment and an overview of relevant MATLAB features in the appendices; provides supplementary software and teaching support material at an associated website, including lecture slides and a methodology for organizing student projects.\n\nStudents at the senior undergraduate or junior graduate level will find this hands-on textbook/reference to be an essential guide to the fundamentals of modelling and simulation. It is also ideally suited for self-study by professionals seeking insight into the vast potential of this rapidly evolving problem-solving paradigm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e22e2b1d9a973ab97a8260204e56ca4ab2eee62","amp;dn":"Modelling+and+Simulation+Exploring+Dynamic+System+Behaviour+2nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e22e2b1d9a973ab97a8260204e56ca4ab2eee62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,34,226,177,217,169,115,171,151,168,38,2,4,229,108,164,171,46,238,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
