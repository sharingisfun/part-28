Anne Burrell brings him four candidates who are tested on their ability to create a refined version of Goulash and on creating an accessible dish using uncommon cuts of organ meat. During the final round's dinner service, one chef's struggle with soup almost sinks his whole service while the other chef lets the intensity get the best of him and finds himself letting the kitchen run him.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 11-Apr-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7b3f508b033cdbf81c9eddd66a49af14ed7bd63","amp;dn":"Chef.Wanted.S02E11.Austrian.Wirsthaus.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7b3f508b033cdbf81c9eddd66a49af14ed7bd63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,179,245,8,176,51,205,191,129,201,237,221,102,164,154,241,78,215,189,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
