As she becomes increasingly involved with both, Diamond begins to uncover a nest of secrets that puts both her heart and her reputation at risk.\n\nBlending the rich historical detail of Philippa Gregory's novels with the sophisticated glamour of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic books, The Jewel Box is romantic historical fiction at its finest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c62dd12d8b0f58787dffc8ef9036ae3a619db778","amp;dn":"The+Jewel+Box+by+Anna+Davis+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c62dd12d8b0f58787dffc8ef9036ae3a619db778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,45,209,45,139,15,88,120,125,255,200,239,144,54,174,58,97,157,183,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
