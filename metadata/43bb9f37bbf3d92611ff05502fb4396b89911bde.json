This torrent includes Mage: The Hero Discovered\n\nMage is an American superhero comic book written and illustrated by Matt Wagner. Three volumes, each of 15 issues are planned; as of 2006, two have been published.\n\nVolume one, The Hero Discovered, was published by Comico from 1984 to 1986. Despite advertisements saying that a sequel was &quot;coming soon&quot;, The Hero Defined did not appear until 1997, published by Image Comics (Comico had gone bankrupt in 1990, and it had taken some time for Wagner to regain the rights to the series). The third and final volume, The Hero Denied, is planned, but no firm publication schedule fixed.\n\nWagner wrote and drew both series, with Sam Kieth as inker for part of the first, and Jeromy Cox as colourist for the second.\n\nZack Snyder has been attached to a film adaptation from 2003.\n\nThe Hero Discovered follows Kevin Matchstick, an alienated young man with an uncanny resemblance to the author, as he meets a wizard called Mirth, discovers he has superhuman abilities, gains a magic baseball bat and defeats the nefarious plans of a being called the Umbra Sprite. He ultimately discovers that Mirth is Merlin, the baseball bat is Excalibur, and he is, in some ambiguous way, King Arthur. It is a story of existentialist engagement and can be read as an allegory for Wagner finding his own voice as an artist. Also, all the chapter titles are lines from Shakespeare&amp;#039;s Hamlet, and the chapters bear more than a passing resemblance to events in the play.\n\nA backup story, Devil by the Deed, appeared in issues 7ÃƒÂ¢??14 of The Hero Discovered. This was a Grendel story that led directly into the Grendel comic series penned by Wagner, and drawn by a series of different artists, changing as each arc of the story changed.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bb9f37bbf3d92611ff05502fb4396b89911bde","amp;dn":"Mage+v1+-+The+Hero+Discovered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bb9f37bbf3d92611ff05502fb4396b89911bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,187,159,55,187,243,217,38,17,255,5,80,47,180,57,107,137,145,27,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
