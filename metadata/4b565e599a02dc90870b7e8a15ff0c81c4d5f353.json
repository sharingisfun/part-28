While the comparisons to bands like R.E.M. were sometimes stretched a bit, there&amp;#039;s no denying the similar love of brisk, economic velocity which crops up on many of these songs, including the steady beat of &quot;Violet Town&quot; and the crisp flow on &quot;Into My Hands.&quot; &quot;No Explanation&quot; perhaps fits the R.E.M. likeness best after a brief instrumental beginning, a shimmering, strummed gem with a great main melody. Kilbey again \nhandles the vocals with his usual mix of low-key singing and sometimes clever, sometimes obscure lyrics, while the band as a whole keep things moving. Willson-Piper, who handles lead vocals for &quot;10,000 Miles&quot; and &quot;Volumes,&quot; and Koppes by now show their excellent guitar abilities almost at every turn, their avoidance of pointless flash in favor of compelling hooks and a little extra shading when needed always coming through. &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot; and &quot;Shadow Cabinet&quot; are just two highlights of their abilities, beautiful and hummable all at once. An interesting if slightly atypical effort on the disc is &quot;Maybe These Boys,&quot; with a \nrelentless keyboard hook that almost sounds like a military fanfare leading into the full band performance, though with further keyboards still prominent. Kilbey&amp;#039;s vocals are eventually contrasted with a Vocodered treatment of the same words, making for a strange, unsettling ending.\n\nMore info at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thechurchband.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thechurchband.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n1.
