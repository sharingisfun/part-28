The album was released on 13 November 2006 by Mute Records (see 2006 in British music).[1]  Other compilation albums by the band include Catching Up with Depeche Mode  and People Are People (both North American-only releases) along with The Singles 81&gt;85 and The Singles 86&gt;98. The current collection consists of selected Depeche Mode singles from their twenty-five year career. Along with two recent singles from the Playing the Angel album, a new song &quot;Martyr&quot; - recorded during the Playing the Angel sessions - is also included in this collection and was released as a single in late October 2006. The album has sold over 1 million copies in Europe alone and has been awarded the IFPI Platinum Europe Award.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Alan Wiley - By their very nature, best-of collections lend themselves to nostalgia, and Depeche Mode's instantly identifiable sound and string of pervasive, catchy singles are undoubtedly the soundtrack to many memories--memories served well by this fine collection of beautifully remastered songs. If you've heard any of the band's double-disc rereleases, you'll have an idea of just how good their remastered songs can sound. While there are some obvious omissions (&quot;Somebody,&quot; &quot;Policy of Truth&quot;), compiling a career-spanning collection of Depeche Mode's best would be considered a challenge for just about anybody; and as this is Vol. 1, it seems obvious that there's more to come. There are a couple odd choices in the mix (&quot;See You,&quot; &quot;New Life&quot;) and the obligatory new track (&quot;Martyr&quot;), but the non-chronological mix makes these classics sound fresh and better than ever.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Personal Jesus [7&quot; Version]\n[02] Just Can't Get Enough\n[03] Everything Counts [Edit]\n[04] Enjoy The Silence [7&quot; Version]\n[05] Shake The Disease\n[06] See You\n[07] It's No Good\n[08] Strangelove [Single Version]\n[09] Suffer Well\n[10] Dream On [Single Version]\n[11] People Are People\n[12] Martyr\n[13] Walking In My Shoes [Seven Inch Mix]\n[14] I Feel You\n[15] Precious\n[16] Master And Servant [Edit]\n[17] New Life\n[18] Never Let Me Down Again [Single Version]\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h: 14m: 38s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 186mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Synthpop, New Wave, Electronica\nRelease Date\t&gt; 13 November 2006\nRecord Company\t&gt; Mute Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.depechemode.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/d/depeche.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/depechemode\n&gt;\n&gt;[Enjoy The Silence]\n&gt;[Personal Jesus]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c728ec3a5b52ca5711b965bf615426c622f32f8c","amp;dn":"%5B2006%5D+The+Best+Of+%28Vol.+1%29+-+Depeche+Mode+522mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c728ec3a5b52ca5711b965bf615426c622f32f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,40,236,58,91,82,202,87,17,185,101,191,97,84,38,198,34,243,47,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
