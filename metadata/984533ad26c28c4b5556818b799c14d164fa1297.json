I. Markushevich in the  Little Mathematics Library.\n\n    This book offers a geometric theory of logarithms, in\n    which (natural) logarithms are represented as areas of\n    various geometrical shapes. All the properties of\n    logarithms, as well as their methods of calculation, are\n    then determined from the properties of the areas. The\n    book introduces most simple concepts and properties of\n    integral calculus, without resort to concept of derivative.\n    The book is intended for all lovers of mathematics,\n    particularly school children.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by I. Aleksanova and was first published by Mir in 1981 with a second reprint in 1987. This book was also part of the Topics in Mathematics (TiM) and was published by D. C. Heath in 1963, This edition was translated from the first Russian version by Ronald S. Toczek and Reuben Sandler. Link is for the Mir 1987 edition, though the TiM edition is also available.\n\nPDF | OCR | Cover | 3.5 MB | 76 pp | 600 dpi\n\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984533ad26c28c4b5556818b799c14d164fa1297","amp;dn":"Markushevich-Areas-and-Logarithms-LML","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984533ad26c28c4b5556818b799c14d164fa1297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,69,51,173,38,194,140,75,85,86,129,139,121,156,20,209,100,250,18,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
