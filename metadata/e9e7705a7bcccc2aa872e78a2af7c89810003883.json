Davis is one of the finest cartoonists of her generation, and has been producing comics since the mid-2000s. Happy represents the best stories she's drawn for such connoisseurial venues as Mome, Nobrow, and Lucky Peach, as well as her own self-publishing and web efforts. Davis achieves a rare, subtle poignancy in her narratives that are at once compelling and elusive, pregnant with mystery and a deeply satisfying emotional resonance. Happy shows the full range of Davis's graphic skills Ã¢â‚¬â€ sketchy drawing, polished pen-and-ink line work, and meticulously designed full-color painted panels Ã¢â‚¬â€ which are always in the service of a narrative that builds to a quietly devastating climax","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9e7705a7bcccc2aa872e78a2af7c89810003883","amp;dn":"Eleanor+Davis+-+How+To+Be+Happy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9e7705a7bcccc2aa872e78a2af7c89810003883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,231,112,90,123,204,204,42,168,114,231,138,42,247,200,152,16,0,56,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
