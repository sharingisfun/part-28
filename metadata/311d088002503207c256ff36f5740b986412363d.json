Though I played it fine with MX player on my android device.\n\nIf you want to play it on your PC, you can easily use VLC, MPC-HC, GOM Player or any other modern media player. just be sure you got the latest version of them.\n\nIf you want to read more about the codec, check this out:                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is nothing you can compare with x264 releases so Don't let the size scare you. small sizes don't always mean LOW QUALITIES.\n\nCheck screenshots then download it and Enjoy. You'll LOVE IT!\n\n\n\n** Special thanks to all the seeders. you are all part of this :) **\n\n\n\nScreenshots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311d088002503207c256ff36f5740b986412363d","amp;dn":"Boardwalk.Empire.S05E03.720p.HDTV.2CH.x265.HEVC-PSA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311d088002503207c256ff36f5740b986412363d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,29,8,128,2,80,50,7,194,86,255,54,245,116,11,152,100,18,54,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
