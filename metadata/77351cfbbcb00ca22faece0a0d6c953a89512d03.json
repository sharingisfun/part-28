It was first published anonymously on January 10, 1776, during the American Revolution. Common Sense, signed &quot;Written by an Englishman&quot;, became an immediate success. In relation to the population of the Colonies at that time, it had the largest sale and circulation of any book in American history. Common Sense presented the American colonists with an argument for freedom from British rule at a time when the question of independence was still undecided. \n\nThomas Paine began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth. With the help of Benjamin Rush, who suggested the title Common Sense and helped edit and publish, Paine developed his ideas into a forty-eight page pamphlet. Paine published Common Sense anonymously because of its treasonous content. Printed and sold by R. Bell, Third Street, Philadelphia, it sold as many as 120,000 copies in the first three months, 500,000 in the first year, and went through twenty-five editions in the first year alone. Paine donated his royalties from Common Sense to George Washington's Continental Army, saying:\n\nAs my wish was to serve an oppressed people, and assist in a just and good cause, I conceived that the honor of it would be promoted by my declining to make even the usual profits of an author.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Thomas Paine\n\nThere were at least two reasons why Paine's brief pamphlet is believed to be &quot;the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era&quot;. For one, while the average Colonist was more educated than their European counterpart, European and Colonial elites agreed that common people had no place in government or political debates. By aiming for a popular audience, and writing in a straightforward and simple way, Paine made political ideas tangible for a common audience. This brought average Americans into political debate, creating a whole new political language. Illiterate colonists could hear Common Sense read at public gatherings, thus bringing even the illiterate into this new political world. Paine's new style of political writing avoided using complex Latin phrases, instead opting for a more direct, concise style that helped make the information accessible to all. Thusly, Paine's &quot;incendiary&quot; words were heard even by those common folk who had never learned to read. The second reason involves the way the vast majority of people felt about the idea of independence from British rule. Except for a few radical thinkers, the people of the colonies were &quot;up on the fence&quot; about freedom. Individuals were in conflict with themselves. There were those who were leaning toward reconciliation with the king. George Trevelyan in his History of the American Revolution had this to say about Paine's pamphlet:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77351cfbbcb00ca22faece0a0d6c953a89512d03","amp;dn":"Thomas+Paine+-+Common+Sense","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77351cfbbcb00ca22faece0a0d6c953a89512d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,53,28,251,188,176,12,162,47,174,206,10,13,108,149,58,137,81,45,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
