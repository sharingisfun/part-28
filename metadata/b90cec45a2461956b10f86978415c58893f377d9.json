Although this guide won't tell you any secrets that'll automatically rank your site first for queries in Google (sorry!), following the best practices outlined below will make it easier for search engines to crawl, index and understand your content.\n\nSearch engine optimization is often about making small modifications to parts of your website. When viewed individually, these changes might seem like incremental improvements, but when combined with other optimizations, they could have a noticeable impact on your site's user experience and performance in organic search results. You're likely already familiar with many of the topics in this guide, because they're essential ingredients for any web page, but you may not be making the most out of them.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b90cec45a2461956b10f86978415c58893f377d9","amp;dn":"Search+engine+optimization+starter+guide.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b90cec45a2461956b10f86978415c58893f377d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,12,236,69,162,70,25,86,177,15,134,151,132,21,197,136,147,243,119,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
