Proposing actions only change the way power or eco-activism (recycling, become a volunteer to rescue turtle, etc.) makes us immediately blamed for the destruction of the planet and responsible to rectify the situation, rather than fighting the real causes, but looking only Our balance between the consumer and the ecological standard of living.
