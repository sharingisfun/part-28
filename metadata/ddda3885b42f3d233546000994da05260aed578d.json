Though the Italian States had many fine composers at the time--just before their musical culture at court, in chapels and in middle class towns was absorbed by the wave of Franco-Flemish musicians--one of the best was acknowledged to be Johannes Ciconia. A good amount of his music has been preserved, at least in relation to the music by many of his contemporaries. (One, Giovanni Mazzuoli, a famous organist in Florence, survives only in a single musical manuscript that the church decided to reuse as an inventory, scraping all the ink off. All that remains is evidence of staves on both the left and right edges of the inventory comments.)\r\n\r\nThis disc is part of a series, most out of print, that Alla Francesca did back in the 1990s. Like everything they've recorded, it shows great energy as well as scholarship.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio of Ciconia is enclosed. So are the original texts in Italian, Latin, and French, translated into English, French, and German.
