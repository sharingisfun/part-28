In recent decades it has become clear that adding depletants such as polymers or small colloids to colloidal dispersions allows one to tune the interactions between the colloids and in this way control the stability, structure and rheological properties of colloidal dispersions. This book offers a concise introduction to the fundamentals of depletion effects and their influence on the phase behavior of colloidal dispersions. Throughout the book, conceptual explanations are accompanied by experimental and computer simulation results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7375a2132a43a789985f9b1e11a8b54a463da0e","amp;dn":"Colloids+and+the+Depletion+Interaction+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7375a2132a43a789985f9b1e11a8b54a463da0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,55,90,33,50,164,58,120,153,133,249,177,225,26,139,84,164,99,218,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
