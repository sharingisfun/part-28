The course focuses on speaking and understanding, and is comprised of a series of audio lessons broken up into separate modules of study. Each module (except #9) has accompanying textbook and workbook pages that should be used to follow along with the lessons. There are no characters: reading and writing Chinese will have to be learnt elsewhere. This course has been pulled off of http://fsi-language-courses.org, and is in the public domain, free for all use. Compiled and uploaded by R0uge on 12 June 2009.
