Such was their success, they went on to be used across the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s railway network well into the 2000s, with many still in use for freight and yard work, and others as Ã¢â‚¬ËœThunderbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rescue locomotives on electrified lines. \n\nDespite their relatively fast top speed of 87mph (140km/h), the Class was displaced by newer diesel multiple units (DMUs), electrification of the rail network and new diesel locomotives introduced by DB. \n\nThe BR 218 for Train Simulator is available in Deutsche Bahn Traffic Red livery and includes a non-powered BR 146 as a failed locomotive to recreate Ã¢â‚¬ËœThunderbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ operations. Features of the model include PZB signalling and a rake of passenger coaches in DB white livery for Quick Drive use, complete with passenger view","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a6a3245caff4651be7f3e6350a393772a10344","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015++DB+BR+218+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a6a3245caff4651be7f3e6350a393772a10344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,166,163,36,92,175,244,101,27,231,243,230,53,10,57,55,114,161,3,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
