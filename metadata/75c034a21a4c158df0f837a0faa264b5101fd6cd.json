The series was written by Will Pfeifer. Artists included Kano, Leonard Kirk and Dale Eaglesham.\n\nThe series' focus was the &quot;H-Dial&quot; that DC had first introduced in &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; in House of Mystery in the 1960s. For this series the Dial was depicted as an object with buttons instead of a dial and was referred to as the H-Device.\n\nUnlike earlier stories, H.E.R.O. did not have one or two protagonists being turned into a new hero every issue, but showed the H-Device passing from bearer to bearer, examining how different people react to the sudden gift of supernatural powers. There was a subplot involving Robby Reed (the main character from the original Dial H for Hero) that ran through most issues and led to the series' final storyline.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.E.R.O._%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.E.R.O._%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75c034a21a4c158df0f837a0faa264b5101fd6cd","amp;dn":"H.E.R.O.+-+DC+Comics+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75c034a21a4c158df0f837a0faa264b5101fd6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,192,52,162,26,76,21,141,240,248,55,160,250,162,100,181,16,31,214,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
