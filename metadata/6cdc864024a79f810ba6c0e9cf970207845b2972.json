Developer Pivotal Games is taking the series\na few decades back to the Vietnam War and is placing you in the role of a\nnew recruit who finds himself cut off behind enemy lines during the 1968\nTet Offensive. Your goal is to make it through 100 miles of booby-trapped\nand enemy-infested terrain, along with your squad, to get to the capital\ncity of Hue. Today we'll offer a look at the new skill system that's being\nimplemented into the latest iteration of Conflict to add a new element to its\ngameplay. The skill advancement system in Conflict: Vietnam lets you choose\none of nine different skill sets for the members of your squad to specialize\nin. These features add a level of customization that makes it possible to\nbuild up all manner of squad configurations, such as a stealth-kill team\nconsisting entirely of snipers or a squad of heavy-weapon experts.\n\nYou'll increase the different skills available to you with points that you\nearn for completing primary and bonus objectives, such as taking down enemy\nsoldiers and vehicles, maintaining fire accuracy, and successfully executing\nstealth kills. Points are deducted for killing civilians and friendly\nsoldiers. These points are split among the four squadmates and are then spent\nto raise their skills in such skill categories as Pistol, Assault Rifle,\nSniper Rifle, Machine Gun, Grenade, Shotgun, Medic, Rocket Launcher,\nand Booby Traps. The higher the skill, the more points it costs to raise.\n   \nNotes:\n======\nTraitors will burn in hell.\nTo our lost friends: May the light be with you always. /Team FairLight","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cdc864024a79f810ba6c0e9cf970207845b2972","amp;dn":"Conflict.Vietnam-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cdc864024a79f810ba6c0e9cf970207845b2972","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,220,134,64,36,167,159,129,11,166,192,233,207,151,2,7,132,91,41,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
