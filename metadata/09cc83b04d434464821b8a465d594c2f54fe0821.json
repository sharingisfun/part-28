It was the first Gov't Mule\nalbum to feature Andy Hess and Danny Louis as permanent members, and it was also the first\nalbum that Gov't Mule did not play live before its release. The title is a reference to the\nfact that the band believes it rocks just like it used to before the death of former bassist\nAllen Woody.\n\nBeginning in late 2005, the album was released to include the Mo' Voodoo EP.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Bad man walking                                      [04:09]\n02.About to rage                                        [08:06]\n03.Perfect shelter                                      [04:53]\n04.Little toy brain                                     [05:12]\n05.Slackjaw jezebel                                     [05:27]\n06.Wine and blood                                       [05:47]\n07.Lola leave your light on                             [06:22]\n08.Silent scream                                        [10:58]\n09.No celebration                                       [06:35]\n10.Mr. man                                              [04:22]\n11.My separate reality                                  [07:03]\n12.New world blues                                      [06:58]\n____\n\n75:52 min\n111,3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09cc83b04d434464821b8a465d594c2f54fe0821","amp;dn":"Govt_Mule-Deja_Voodoo-%28Retail%29-2004-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09cc83b04d434464821b8a465d594c2f54fe0821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,204,131,176,77,67,68,100,130,27,138,70,93,89,76,47,84,254,8,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
