Since this elusive 1971 record appeared in Hans Pokora's 3001 Record Collector Dreams book, most collectors (including those in Japan) were searching for this album with no luck. So now it's time to solve another mystery: beside the other unknown albums shown in the same book, 3/3 and Olive, Martha is the one everybody was talking about the most. What is it? Has anybody seen it? It's so rare, but is it any good? Martha is the first of three albums composed by the Japanese artist, Kamijo. The other two are Tomo (also very rare) and Tomoaki Kamijo KK Band's Dear My Friend (Pretty Are Too), but Martha is the best of them all. All English vocals, lots of fuzz guitar, percussion, piano and great vocals. An underground-rock album with folky elements and a West Coast touch. Kamijo is the Mick Stevens of Japan. Five musicians, ten great songs.
