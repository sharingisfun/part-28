It features Toxie, the lead character of the films leading a trio of misfit superheroes who combat pollution. This followed a trend of environmentally considerate cartoons of the time, including Captain Planet and the Planeteers, Swamp Thing, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. As this incarnation was aimed at children, Toxic Crusaders is considerably tamer than the edgy films it was based on (although it nevertheless contain many adult-oriented jokes that would go over most children's heads). Thirteen episodes were produced and aired, with at least a few episodes airing as a &quot;trial run&quot; in Summer 1990 followed by the official debut on January 21, 1991.\n\nMKV rips from DVDs using makemkv.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7afb60e4f08d91249205ac2e972b448d2a4f6c1","amp;dn":"The+Toxic+Crusaders+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7afb60e4f08d91249205ac2e972b448d2a4f6c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,175,182,14,79,8,217,18,73,32,90,194,233,114,180,72,210,164,246,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
