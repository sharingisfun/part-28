The result is a vibrant, brainy specimen of a woman clad in a heap of T-shirts, frumpy sweaters and hiking shoes. But she's barely a student anymore Ã¢â‚¬â€ she's the one teaching the kids. She admits that she sometimes wishes that a &quot;beam from outer space would come down and dress me.&quot; Enter the twin beams of supreme sartorial therapy, Stacy and Clinton. Can they help Lizzie to understand that there's nothing wrong with having a beautiful mind and a beautiful image?\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 521 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 42s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 705 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf52.39.0\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 42mn 42s\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.607\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.186\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 42s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 58.7 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f9dc3a108b62172571e973503d6c322e963c7f","amp;dn":"What.Not.To.Wear+s08e09+Lizzie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f9dc3a108b62172571e973503d6c322e963c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,249,220,58,16,139,98,23,37,113,233,115,80,61,108,50,46,150,60,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
