Manuel Pellegrini's side beat Spurs 6-0 in the reverse fixture back in November, but Tim Sherwood's arrival as manager had an immediate effect and helped steady the ship after an indifferent start to the season. In Wednesday's other games, Chelsea host West Ham in an all-London clash at Stamford Bridge, while another local derby takes place in the Midlands as Aston Villa take on West Brom, and Sunderland face Stoke. In Tuesday night's matches, Merseyside rivals Liverpool and Everton go head-to-head at Anfield, while new Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returns to Manchester United, a club he enjoyed huge success at as a player. Elsewhere, Norwich play Newcastle, Southampton host Arsenal, Fulham travel to Swansea and Crystal Palace take on Hull.\n\n\nNotes:\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps which gives more fluid, smoother movement.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb814d73a3acab1ee16e70eff231b7d92b14bb0","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2014-01-29+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb814d73a3acab1ee16e70eff231b7d92b14bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,184,20,215,58,58,202,177,238,22,231,14,255,35,27,125,146,177,75,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
