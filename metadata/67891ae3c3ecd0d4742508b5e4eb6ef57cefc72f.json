The first engagement at Brandywine, the inconclusive battle of the Clouds, the controversial Paoli Massacre, the missed opportunity at Germantown, and the maturing of an army at Valley Forge, are all examined in detail by Justin Clement, with supporting maps, original artwork, and photographs.\n\nRecently discovered information about the battle of Brandywine and analysis of the major personalities involved, completes this comprehensive account of an important episode in the American War of Independence (1775-1783).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67891ae3c3ecd0d4742508b5e4eb6ef57cefc72f","amp;dn":"Philadelphia+1777%3A+Taking+the+capital","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67891ae3c3ecd0d4742508b5e4eb6ef57cefc72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,137,26,227,195,236,208,212,116,37,8,181,228,235,110,245,124,239,199,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
