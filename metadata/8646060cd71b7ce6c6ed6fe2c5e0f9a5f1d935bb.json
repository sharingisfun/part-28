On the morning of March 26, 1970, they began hearing radio calls from an infantry unit four kilometers away that had stumbled into a hidden North Vietnamese Army stronghold. Outnumbered at least six to one, the ninety-man American company was quickly surrounded, pinned down, and fighting for its existence. Helicopters could not penetrate the dense jungle, and artillery and air support could not be targeted effectively. The company was fated to be worn down and eventually all killed or captured.\n\nOverhearing the calls for help on his radio, Captain John Poindexter, Alpha TroopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twenty-five-year-old commander, realized that his outfit was the only hope for the trapped company. It just might be possible that they could Ã¢â‚¬Å“bustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ enough jungle by nightfall to reach them. Not making the attempt was deemed unacceptable, so he ordered his men to Ã¢â‚¬Å“saddle up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With the courage and determination that makes legends out of ordinary men, they effected a daring rescue and fought a pitched battleÃ¢â‚¬â€at considerable cost. Many brave deeds were done that day and Captain Poindexter tried to make sure his men were recognized for their actions.\n\nThirty years later Poindexter was made aware that his award recommendations and even the records of the battle had somehow gone missing. Thus began the second phase of this remarkable story: a Ã¢â‚¬Å“battleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to ensure that his brave menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accomplishments would never be forgotten again.\n\nThe full circle was completed when President Obama stepped to the podium on October 20, 2009, to award the Alpha Troop with the Presidential Unit Citation: the highest combat award that can be given to a military unit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8646060cd71b7ce6c6ed6fe2c5e0f9a5f1d935bb","amp;dn":"Blackhorse+Riders%3A+A+Desperate+Last+Stand%2C+an+Extraordinary+Resc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8646060cd71b7ce6c6ed6fe2c5e0f9a5f1d935bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,70,6,12,215,27,124,230,198,237,111,226,197,224,249,165,241,217,53,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
