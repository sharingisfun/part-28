Such is the life of an only child living in postwar Bucharest, a city that is changing in ever more frightening ways. EvaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, full of eccentric and opinionated adults, will do absolutely anything to keep her safeÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means hiding her identity from her. With razor-sharp depictions of her animated relatives, Haya Leah MolnarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir of her childhood captures with touching precocity the very adult realities of living behind the iron curtain.\n\nUnder a Red Sky is a 2011 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.&quot;\n\nReview:\n&quot;Molnar began life as Eva Zimmerman, an adored only child living in the apartment shared by her parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles in Bucharest, Romania. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loving but eccentric family sheltered her as much as possible from the harsh realities of life under communist rule, when food and housing were scarce and the Securitate, RomaniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret police, watched and listened everywhere. Her father, a cinematographer, believed in science, not God, and neither religion nor World War II were spoken of at home, so it came as a huge shock to Molnar when she learned in 1958 that her entire family had applied to emigrate to Israel and that she is Jewish. All I know is that yesterday I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Jewish and today I am, says Molnar in describing her struggle to understand her new identity. As Eva pieces together her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, a vivid story emerges, ranging from funny, tender moments of family life to the horrific revelations of the Romanian holocaust, about which little has been written. Black-and-white family photos illustrate this poignant, memorable offering.&quot; -Lynn Rutan, Booklist\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
