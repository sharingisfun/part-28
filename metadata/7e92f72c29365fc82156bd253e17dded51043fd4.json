Yet, with their shadow lamps destroyed and key pieces of the map still missing, the journey will be far more difficult than they imagine. And when one of their own disappears with Sir HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cryptic Green Book, they no longer know who to trust.\n\nAt the same time, the Zetetic Society has uncovered a terrifying secret which, if proven, will rock the very foundations of Creation. The quest for answers is no longer limited to recovering an unknown treasure. The fate of the universe depends on unraveling the riddle of the Skin Map.\n\n\n\nThough I have the other 3 books, Pharmakate has them already uploaded (gotta say thanks to him) in this bundle\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8612972/Stephen_R._Lawhead_-_20_books_(epub__mobi)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8612972/Stephen_R._Lawhead_-_20_books_(epub__mobi)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e92f72c29365fc82156bd253e17dded51043fd4","amp;dn":"The+Shadow+Lamp+%28a+bright+empires+novel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e92f72c29365fc82156bd253e17dded51043fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,146,247,44,41,54,95,200,33,86,189,37,62,23,221,237,81,4,63,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
