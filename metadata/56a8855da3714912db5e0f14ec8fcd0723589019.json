He has just a few hours to learn the skills of racing on sheet ice before he takes on a rally champion over a treacherous rally stage. The potential for disaster waits around every corner. Jonny Smith journeys to Iceland to drive Land RoverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Discovery Sport. On paper it seems to be the perfect all-round car, combining brilliant off-road ability, with comfort, sportiness and space for seven. Jonny has a day to put the car through its paces, which includes driving through blizzards and a very wide, freezing, river.\n\nMany Thanks To Original Capper And TVCUK!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a8855da3714912db5e0f14ec8fcd0723589019","amp;dn":"Fifth+Gear+S26E04+HDTV+x264-TVCUK+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a8855da3714912db5e0f14ec8fcd0723589019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,168,133,93,163,113,73,18,219,94,15,20,236,143,205,7,35,88,144,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
