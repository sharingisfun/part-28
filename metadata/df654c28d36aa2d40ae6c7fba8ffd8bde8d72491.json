Swaddled in wealth and excess, Scott and Liberace have a long affair, one that eventually Scott begins to find suffocating. Kept away from the outside world by the flashily effeminate yet deeply closeted Liberace, and submitting to extreme makeovers and even plastic surgery at the behest of his lover, Scott eventually rebels. When Liberace finds himself a new lover, Scott is tossed on the street. He then seeks legal redress for what he feels he has lost. But throughout, the bond between the young man and the star never completely tears.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df654c28d36aa2d40ae6c7fba8ffd8bde8d72491","amp;dn":"Behind+The+Candelabra+2013+HDTVRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df654c28d36aa2d40ae6c7fba8ffd8bde8d72491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,101,76,40,211,106,162,212,10,230,199,251,168,255,216,189,232,215,36,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
