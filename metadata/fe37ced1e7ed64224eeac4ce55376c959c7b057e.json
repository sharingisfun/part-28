Anarchy has spread like a plague across the seas to the Empires of the South and East. The Empires, Nations and Kingdoms of Orbis have collapsed in on themselves, breaking down into Baronies, Provinces and City States. Each manâ€™s hand is set against his brothersâ€™ in terrible bloody battles for survival and supremacy. Chaos is driving the provinces apart and the Empire closer to war.\r\nWarrior Kings: Battles is set in the amazing and living medieval fantasy world of Orbis.
