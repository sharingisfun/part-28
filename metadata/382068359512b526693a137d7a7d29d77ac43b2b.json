Released in 2002, the single peaked at #18 in the USA and at #13 in the U.K.\n\nAccording to a magazine interview, the song describes their frustration with their label in the making of the album. The band thought they had enough material for a release, but when the label told them to keep writing, Adam Levine wrote this song in frustration of the pressure.\n\nThe video is centered around the band playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout the course of the video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures on both sides of the wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382068359512b526693a137d7a7d29d77ac43b2b","amp;dn":"Maroon+5+-+Harder+To+Breathe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382068359512b526693a137d7a7d29d77ac43b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,32,104,53,149,18,181,38,105,58,19,125,122,125,41,215,122,196,59,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
