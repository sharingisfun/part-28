Many famous rock bands and performers played there in the early 1970s and the Dead played two nights, March 22 and 23 according to the ticket.  The show has always been listed on official Grateful Dead playlists as taking place on March 24.\n\nSoundboard recording, frankly tampered with to make one CD without cuts and weird channel drop-outs, etc.  The end result is faithful to the spirit of the event, which was a short, relatively tight set whose length was dictated by the Pirates World people and regulations, or perhaps in part by local ordinances. Who really knows at this late date?\n\nEnjoy this great show. May it &quot;amuse&quot; you.\n\nTRACK LIST\n01 Cold Rain and Snow\n02 Don't Ease Me In\n03 Good Lovin'\n04 High Time\n05 Dark Star\n06 The Other One\n07 St. Stephen\n08 Not Fade Away\n09 Turn On Your Lovelight\n10 Me and My Uncle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d329d68cc08682272b8e0ff20f07faa2ec0d8ad6","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+March+1970+Pirates+World+%28Florida%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d329d68cc08682272b8e0ff20f07faa2ec0d8ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,41,214,140,192,134,130,39,43,142,15,242,15,7,250,162,236,13,138,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
