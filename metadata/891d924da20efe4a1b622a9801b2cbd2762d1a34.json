He doesn t know anyone around but it's comfy enough in its boring routine. Erika, a pretty neighbor, catches his eye. They meet, they talk. Before they know it, they're an item. Before they know it, in fact, they're very very together. It s a high but it s frightening. Is it really the right choice? Are they really for each other or just escaping loneliness? There's great moments. There's doubts. In the midst of happiness, Kyle gets nightmares of pulling his teeth out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:891d924da20efe4a1b622a9801b2cbd2762d1a34","amp;dn":"Flower+and+Fade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"891d924da20efe4a1b622a9801b2cbd2762d1a34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,29,146,77,162,14,254,74,27,98,42,152,1,178,203,210,118,45,26,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
