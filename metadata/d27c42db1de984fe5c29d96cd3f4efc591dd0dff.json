Then, learn the secrets of the villain Eclipso as it makes its way across the DCU to sway heroes to its side!\n\nCountdown To Mystery #1 (of 8)\nThe Helmet of Fate has chosen its new bearer: Kent Nelson--a man so far down on his luck, he doesn't know what luck is! The transformative nature of the helmet grants him powers he can't begin to comprehend, but will they make his life better, or even worse? Plus, Eclipso becomes the temptress of the DCU, bribing its heroes to the dark side in more ways than one!\n\nCountdown to Mystery #2 (of 8)\nDoctor Fate faces a steep learning curve when it comes to mastering his new powers as he faces &quot;The Devourer of Souls&quot; in Las Vegas!

Plus, a shocking new development in the life of Eclipso!\n\nCountdown To Mystery #5 (of 8)\nThe return of Eclipso is bad news for the DC Universe, but it's worse news for Bruce Gordon, the man who originally held the Black Diamond and terrorized the world as Eclipso!

Can Crispus Allen convince him otherwise?\n\nCountdown To Mystery #8 (of 8)\nEclipso is once more bound to Bruce Gordon!
