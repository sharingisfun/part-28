He can be everything!\nDeadpool first time in history became the hero of action, and he really wants to outshine colleagues.

And he delivers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db3ec6580b003be19fcb8a9174dc53ec137273de","amp;dn":"Deadpool+%2BDLCS+RePack+By+R.G.+Revenants+NASWARI%2BZOHAIB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db3ec6580b003be19fcb8a9174dc53ec137273de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,62,198,88,11,0,59,225,159,203,138,145,116,220,83,236,19,114,115,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
