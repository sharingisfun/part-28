This CFW has minimal modifications over 4.50 OFW and contains the basic patches from v4.46 CFW. The toolbox was not added to this version, maybe we will see that in future updates. One thing to take note of is the lack of testing that has been done on this CFW. The developer who has created many CFW versions only tested this release 5 minutes on his own console. So that is something that you should be well-aware of before attempting to install this CFW as there is always potential bricks that can occur.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde5792566730adc32734a9e570879a9c2ce2582","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+Rogero+4.50+v1.00%2Bflash+tool+v4.50","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde5792566730adc32734a9e570879a9c2ce2582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,229,121,37,102,115,10,220,50,115,74,158,87,8,121,169,194,206,37,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
