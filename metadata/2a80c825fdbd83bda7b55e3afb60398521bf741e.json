While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia - who is slowly regaining her powers - it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a80c825fdbd83bda7b55e3afb60398521bf741e","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Vol.+27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a80c825fdbd83bda7b55e3afb60398521bf741e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,128,200,37,253,189,131,189,167,181,94,58,251,96,57,133,33,191,116,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
