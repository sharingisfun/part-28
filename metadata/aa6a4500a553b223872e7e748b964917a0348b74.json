Because isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the South one big feast of meaty indulgence? DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t vegetables play a supporting role to fried chicken and bacon on a Southern table? Justin Fox Burks and Amy Lawrence turn that notion on its head by recasting garden bounty as the headlining act on a plate. In a region distinguished by ideal growing conditions and generations of skilled farmers, Southern-style vegetarian cooking is not only possible, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pursuit brimming with vine-ripened possibility.\n\nGrab a chair in Burks and LawrenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kitchen and discover modern recipes that evoke the flavors of traditional Southern cooking, with techniques and ingredients loved so dearly throughout the region:     \n\n\n-Lemon Zest and Thyme Pimento Cheese\n\n-Grilled Watermelon and Tomato Salad with Honey Lime Vinaigrette\n\n-Okra Fritters with Creole Mustard Sauce\n\n-Vegetarian Red Beans and Rice with Andouille Eggplant\n\n-Roast Beet Salad with Sea Salt Granola and Honey Tarragon Dressing\n\n-Grilled Peach Ice Cream\n\n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a devoted plant-eater or a steadfast omnivore, The Southern Vegetarian Cookbook will help you shift vegetables from the outskirts of your plate into main course position. Eating your vegetables has never been more delicious.\n\n&quot;True Southern food will always adapt to its surroundings. It is not the stubborn lout that many think it is, rather itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nimble cheerleader of its region. It revels in vegetables and cherishes seasons. Burks and Lawrence are adding healthy substance to the definition of our Southern food. The Southern Vegetarian is a great addition to any culinary library.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Hugh Acheson, author of A New Turn in the South\n\n&quot;Come eat with The Chubby Vegetarian.
