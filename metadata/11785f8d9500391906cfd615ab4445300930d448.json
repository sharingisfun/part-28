Life at 1 is the first installment in a landmark series that aims to unlock the secrets of child development by following 11 babies and their families for seven years. We witness the factors that impact their lives, watch the interplay of nature and nurture, and talk to experts to find out what limits children's growth and wellbeing and what makes them thrive. Made in conjunction with the long-term study in which 10,000 Australian children have been placed under a sociological and scientific microscope, this groundbreaking program will try to discover what creates a happy, healthy child and what makes us who we are. Join us for the beginning of an extraordinary journey...
