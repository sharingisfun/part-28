With no country and no allies, what's left for the Sentinel of Liberty to protect? Just the one thing that his foe values most... Zola's son! Steve has saved the boy's life, but can he keep him alive against the savage barbarians of Phrox -- with the fate of a world hinging on his victory?\n\nPlus: introducing Jet Black... the woman who's waited her whole life for the chance to destroy Captain America!\n\nMeanwhile, Zola's plans continue to move forward -- and threaten to curse Steve Rogers for years to come.\n\n------\n\nThis has been my favorite series from Marvel NOW... Romita Jr. &amp; Janson's art is flawless. Remender is crafting a story about a hero facing impossible odds... and he's managed to actually make Cap's book different from anything else in the line... if you haven't tried it, now's a great time to check it out. My highest recommendation!  --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc968ed76166c95f7815e6b19156af8a08a4cde5","amp;dn":"CAPTAIN+AMERICA+%28Marvel+NOW%29+001-007+%28Up-to-date+through+May+29%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc968ed76166c95f7815e6b19156af8a08a4cde5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,150,142,215,97,102,201,95,120,21,230,177,145,86,175,138,8,164,205,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
