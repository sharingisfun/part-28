Business is not war, but it is a form of conflict Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that is, a situation where one company can win only if another loses. If you dig beneath BoydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war-centered tactics you find a general strategy for ensuring that yours is the one that wins. Although Boyd never wrote a business book himself, he read and commented on every version of this manuscript until his death in 1997.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8b597929910eb38afe2dc48457d333953458df","amp;dn":"Certain+to+Win+%5Bmobi%5D+-+Chet+Richards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8b597929910eb38afe2dc48457d333953458df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,139,89,121,41,145,14,179,138,254,45,196,132,87,211,51,149,52,88,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
