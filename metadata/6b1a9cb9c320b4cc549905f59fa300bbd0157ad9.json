The Imperial torturer who trained her is dead, the human empire is disbanded, and she is finally free.\r\n\r\nBut Raena is troubled by a series of nightmares that always seem to end with her shooting an ex-lover in the head. She needs to get her mind clear because thereâ€™s a flaw in the most commonly used starship driveâ€”and the band of media-obsessed pirates sheâ€™s fallen in with is right at the heart of the controversy.\r\n\r\nWith humanity scattered across the galaxy, sheâ€™s going to have to rely on the alien crew members of the Veracity to help her put the pieces together. It doesnâ€™t help that the Templarsâ€” wiped out in a genetic plague while Raena was imprisonedâ€”have left booby-trapped biotechnology scattered across the galaxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Suzy Jackson\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1a9cb9c320b4cc549905f59fa300bbd0157ad9","amp;dn":"Loren+Rhoads+-+Kill+by+Numbers+%28In+the+Wake+of+the+Templars+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1a9cb9c320b4cc549905f59fa300bbd0157ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,26,156,185,195,32,180,204,84,153,5,245,159,163,0,187,208,21,122,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
