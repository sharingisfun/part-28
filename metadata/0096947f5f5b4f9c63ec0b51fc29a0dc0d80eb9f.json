He's the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move.\n\nEven though Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce--and goes out of his way to make that very clear--she can't let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, she has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret . . . even if it kills her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0096947f5f5b4f9c63ec0b51fc29a0dc0d80eb9f","amp;dn":"Lauren+Kate+-+Fallen+%28Unabridged%29%28Book+1%29+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0096947f5f5b4f9c63ec0b51fc29a0dc0d80eb9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,150,148,127,95,91,79,156,99,236,11,81,252,41,160,220,13,128,235,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
