TRIP HOP &amp; POST TRIP HOP MUSIC\n\n         Trip hop  is a music genre consisting of downtempo electronic music which originated in the early 1990s in the UK, especially Bristol. Deriving from &quot;post&quot;-acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz.  Musically, trip hop contains a slow tempo and a hypnotic sound created by an electronic background and prominent string instrumentation. Several trip hop artists and bands, such as Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead and Morcheeba have received attention and/or chart success, both on mainstream national charts and on the more dance and indie-based ones.\n        After the success of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky albums in 1994 and 1995, a new generation of trip hop artists emerged with a more standardized sound. Notable &quot;post-trip-hop&quot; artists include Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto. They integrated trip hop with other genres ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including ambient, R&amp;B/soul, IDM, experimental industrial, atmospheric drum n bass/jungle, liquid dubstep, breakbeat, drum 'n' bass, acid jazz, and new age.\n\n             \n             MASSIVE ATTACK  -  Be Thankful for What You've Got (1991)\n             MADONNA  &amp; MASSIVE ATTACK  - Want You  (1995)\n             MASSIVE ATTACK  - Inertia Creeps  (1998)\n             TRICKY  -  Evolution Revolution Love  (2001)\n             MORCHEEBA Feat..Big Daddy Kane  - What's Your Name  (2003)  \n             MORCHEEBA  -  Wonders never cease  (2005)\n             MASSIVE ATTACK  -  Live With Me (Performance Version) (2006)\n             MASSIVE ATTACK  -  Live With Me  (second version)  (2006)\n             MASSIVE ATTACK  -  Safe From Harm ( 2006)\n             PORTISHEAD  - The Rip  (2008)\n             PORTISHEAD  - Magic Doors  (2008)\n             GRACE JONES  -  Corporate Cannibal  (2008)\n\n\n\n\n     &quot;Be Thankful for What You Got&quot; is a soul song written and first performed by William DeVaughn.(1974).

Many problems arose internally, which resulted in &quot;You'll See&quot; being quickly released as a single instead. The video received heavy airplay on both MTV and VH1. Along with medium radio airplay, many fans speculated as to why the song was never released as an official single. Neither Massive Attack nor Madonna have commented on this matter.Because the song was not released officially as a single, &quot;I Want You&quot; never got into the charts.\n    &quot;Evolution Revolution Love&quot;  is a song written by Tricky and released in 2001 on the album &quot;Blowback&quot;.&quot;Evolution Revolution Love&quot; (track 2) features Ed Kowalczyk of the American rock band Live singing the vocals for the chorus.\n    &quot;Corporate Cannibal&quot; is a single by Grace Jones, released in 2008.The song was written by Grace Jones, Ivor Guest, Adam Green and Marc van Eyck, and is a trip hop song incorporating rock and electronic elements.The video was shot in black an white, with the only images appearing being Grace Jones' face and upper body shots, digitally distorted.
