Facing criticism that it is simply an outlet for Internet piracy, the file locker service headed by Kim Dotcom created a star-studded video of celebrities quite literally singing the praises of the service. Sadly, as quickly as the bewildering video came into our lives (and our hearts) was it pulled from YouTube after a copyright complaint from Universal Music Group (UMG).\n\nThe video was commissioned byfounder Kim Dotcom and features the likes of P. Diddy, Kanye West, Will.i.am, Snoop Dogg, Alicia Keys, Jamie Foxx, Lil John,\nKim Kardashian,&amp; more . The video went viral very quickly, making it to TwitterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trending topics within a short amount of time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and then Universal Music stepped in.\n\nThis is the Original Video, blocked one. \nMega[Upload] owns everything in this video, I own Nothing !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d17a21480e70262ef65c1c0a5500cb743083fc0","amp;dn":"Kanye+ft+ChrisBrown+%26amp%3BPDiddy+-+Song%5B2011%5D+blocked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d17a21480e70262ef65c1c0a5500cb743083fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,23,162,20,128,231,2,98,239,101,193,192,165,80,12,183,67,8,63,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
