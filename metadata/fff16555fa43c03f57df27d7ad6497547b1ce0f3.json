Japanese audio with English custom subs (thanks to ADC!). Starring Eiko Koike, \n\n&quot;Permanent Nobara&quot; is another off beat dramatic comedy from the director of the excellent &quot;Funuke Show Some Love, You Losers!&quot;. The combination of a somewhat low key method of film making, along with a general under current of steady weirdness throughout, is inherent to this director's approach to storytellingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and, if this movie and &quot;FunukeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; are any indication, it's obvious this is something this director is quite good at.\n\nMiho Kanno stars as Naoko; a single mom with a young daughter who's forced to relocate to her backwards home town after her recent divorce. It soon becomes clear that just about everyone living in this small seaside fishing village is a little offÃ¢â‚¬Â¦from her now grown childhood friends, to the unreliable available men in town, to the oversexed and overly gossipy gaggle of middle aged hags who hang out at a hair salon that does only one hair style; tightly coiled perms that look dreadful.\n\nNaoko has no choice but to reintegrate herself into this small town however, and, she does so as best as possible while she tries to get her life back together. Her daily dealings with the strange collection of town folk is frequently amusing and sometimes touching. She doesn't seem to mind or even care that everyone in town is a bit weird, and she in no way looks down on these people....\n\nThere are a fair amount of comedic scenes here (sometimes darkly so), but this movie is much more of a dramatically driven affair than compared to &quot;Funuke...&quot;. It can be quite a bit sad at times actually, but there is enough comedy throughout, and plenty of the wonderful signature strangeness I've now come to expect from this directorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I'm very much looking forward to his next film.\n\n\nSeeding might be on and off and slow - but it will get done. No worries.
