A self-released, self-titled album followed that same year and garnered a local buzz in the area. But after that brief period, the \n\ngroup basically went underground, performing only occasionally. At the same time, lead singer Ryan Jordan gave the group one year to make it in the music business. If \n\nthe group failed, he would return to community college and then head to DePaul University to become a theater major. In 2000, the group renamed themselves \n\nGreenwheel and released a four-song demo. The band also performed at various showcases in New York City, which caught the attention of Island Records. The label \n\nsigned the group, who then went to Nashville to write and record their new album. The album, Soma Holiday, was released in June 2002 on Island Records. The band \n\nhas been compared to the likes of everyone from Train and Matchbox Twenty to Linkin Park for its performance and pop/rock style.\n\n\n-=Song List=-\n01 Shelter\n02 Sustain You\n03 Breathe\n04 Louder Than Words\n05 Strong\n06 Drowning Man\n07 Faces\n08 Identity\n09 Disappear\n10 Dim Halo\n11 Radiance\n12 The End\n\n\n-=Other Information=-\nBit Rate: 192 Kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nSample Rate: 32 kHz\n\n\n-=Special Shouts=-\nTo everyone seeding and supporting torrents.\n\n-=Questions, Comments, Concerns=-\nComment please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a13a229361cf144818a3c2416b5a4e3dea0ea4","amp;dn":"Greenwheel+-+Soma+Holiday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1a13a229361cf144818a3c2416b5a4e3dea0ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,161,58,34,147,97,207,20,72,24,163,194,65,107,90,78,61,234,14,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
