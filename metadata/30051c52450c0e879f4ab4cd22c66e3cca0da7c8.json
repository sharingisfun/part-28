Their music uses three guitars as well as bass, drums, and now keyboards. Like many alternative country acts, the Drive-By Truckers record in analog (using 2 inch tape). However, unlike the majority of their contemporaries, the Drive-By Truckers have consistently pushed their labels to also release the band's records in a vinyl format. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nGo-Go Boots is the title of the upcoming Drive-By Truckers &quot;R&amp;B murder&quot; album and is set to be released in the United States on February 15, 2011 and a day earlier elsewhere. This will be the Drive-By Truckers' ninth studio album (eleventh total). The album was recorded over three blocks of sessions resulting in 25 songs, which the band decided to split between The Big To-Do and its follow up Go-Go Boot's. After The Big To-Do's release, the band continued working on and tweaking the album throughout 2010. Go-Go Boots marks the eighth Drive-By Truckers album produced by David Barbe. Wes Freed will once again be providing the album artwork.\n\nGuitarist and frontman Patterson Hood has described the album to be the band's &quot;most different and most Muscle Shoals sounding album.&quot; The Drive-By Trucker's will include two covers by fellow Muscle Shoals artist Eddie Hinton on the album. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Go_Boots_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Go_Boots_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ I Do Believe\n02 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Go-Go Boots\n03 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ DancinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Ricky\n04 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Cartoon Gold\n05 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ RayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Automatic Weapon\n06 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Everybody Needs Love\n07 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Assholes\n08 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The Weakest Man\n09 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Used To Be A Cop\n10 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The Fireplace Poker\n11 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ WhereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Eddie\n12 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The Thanksgiving Filter\n13 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Pulaski\n14 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Mercy Buckets\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.drivebytruckers.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.drivebytruckers.com/&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-order a copy here!)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Go_Boots_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Go_Boots_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAS ALWAYS: ENJOY AND REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30051c52450c0e879f4ab4cd22c66e3cca0da7c8","amp;dn":"Drive-By+Truckers+-+Go-Go+Boots+%282011%29%28ADVANCE%29%28Alternative+Coun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30051c52450c0e879f4ab4cd22c66e3cca0da7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,5,28,82,69,12,14,135,159,74,180,205,34,198,110,60,202,13,167,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
