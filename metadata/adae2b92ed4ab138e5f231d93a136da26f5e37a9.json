Out of four, here's the first one: Rescue Shot. It's a pretty short but good game for those new to the light gun genre. Ripped with MagicDisc, tested on ePSXe and it worked fine. If you like it, seed it, and if you've got something to say about the torrent, go ahead and leave a comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adae2b92ed4ab138e5f231d93a136da26f5e37a9","amp;dn":"%5BPSX%5D+Rescue+Shot+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adae2b92ed4ab138e5f231d93a136da26f5e37a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,174,43,146,237,74,177,56,229,242,49,217,58,19,109,162,111,94,55,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
