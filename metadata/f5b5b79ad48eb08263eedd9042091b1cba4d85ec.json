NapoleonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??s campaigns were addressed back in the 1960s with Avalon HillÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??s Waterloo board game, which introduced historical elements on a hexagonal board. Units were represented by cardboard squares. \n\nShrapnel Games, along with BreakAway Games, has just released Austerlitz: NapoleonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??s Greatest Victory for the PC. Gone are the hexagons, as well as other paraphernalia associated with board games. What has replaced it is intriguing maps, the sounds of battle, the animation of a charging horse unit, or infantry marching with determination into the line of cannon fire. \n\nAusterlitz will not dazzle with its graphical elements, but what it will do is delight fans of war games with its depth of play.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b5b79ad48eb08263eedd9042091b1cba4d85ec","amp;dn":"Austerlitz+Napoleon%5C%27s+Greatest+Victory+Full+PC+shrapnel+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b5b79ad48eb08263eedd9042091b1cba4d85ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,181,183,154,212,142,176,130,99,238,221,144,66,9,27,28,186,77,133,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
