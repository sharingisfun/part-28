The Real Thing [19:59]\n\nDrummer Alphonse Mouzon cut some of the hardest, heaviest fusion albums ever to hit the Blue Note label in the 70s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including this legendary powerhouse of a record! The set features Mouzon with one of his longtime partners Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitarist Tommy Bolin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hitting a hard-rocking, heavy fusion sound that really blows off the roof Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more than enough influence from the younger generation to showcase the new energy hitting electric jazz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a bit like some of the work that Alphonse would do with other artists in later years! Mouzon's drums explode like a case of dynamite hitting a nitroglycerine factory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and Bolin wails away on guitar like a buzzsaw out of control. There's some nice little licks on the set Ã¢â‚¬â€œ making the record a good one for the sample crowd Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a really high octane album with loads of nice changes! Titles include &quot;Nitroglycerin&quot;, &quot;Mind Transplant&quot;, &quot;Snow Bound&quot;, &quot;Ascorbic Acid&quot;, and &quot;Carbon Dioxide&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/mind-transplant-mw0000536933&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/mind-transplant-mw0000536933&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dustygroove.com/item/69244&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dustygroove.com/item/69244&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3260c3b7876df2dcbf2946f3370f7df39dcb4a","amp;dn":"Alphonse+Mouzon+-+Mind+Transplant+%281975%29+Tommy+Bolin+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3260c3b7876df2dcbf2946f3370f7df39dcb4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,50,96,195,183,135,109,242,220,191,41,70,243,55,15,125,243,157,203,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
