It includes four sub-series which are Phonetics, Everyday Chinese, Business Chinese and Trade and Economy, aiming at teaching Chinese from four perspectives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ listening, speaking, reading and writing. The Phonetics book is a supplementary one at the starterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s level, while the other three are designed for learners at the beginning, elementary and intermediate levels respectively. This series is applicable for short-term intensive training courses, which are designed for those who have zero knowledge of the Chinese language.One of the key features is the case studies in teaching, which combines language study and case analysis into an organic one. This series has been piloted in the EU-China Junior Managers Training Program for three years and is becoming more and more mature.\n\nPDF + MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e812bfc68a12b64393d87e42631b92eabcb1cd48","amp;dn":"Chinese+for+Managers+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e812bfc68a12b64393d87e42631b92eabcb1cd48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,18,191,198,138,18,182,67,147,216,126,66,99,27,146,234,188,177,205,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
