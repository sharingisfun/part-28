One particular role originally written for him was Ren's deadbeat father. However, he gave Craig Brewer his blessing. \n\nUnlike the original, Kenny Wormald performed most of his own dance moves due to his dancing background. \n\nThe film is dedicated to the original 'Footloose' (1984) director, Herbert Ross. Not only in the end credits, but the cop who pulls over Ren has &quot;H. Ross&quot; on his name tag. He is credited as Officer Herb. \n\nAlthough it is pretty rare, there have been individual towns or counties in the U.S. that have forbidden public dancing by law. For instance, in 1980, People Magazine ran a story about students at Elmore City High School in Elmore City, Oklahoma, who had to lobby the town's and school's officials for permission to have a prom. They were successful, and their prom was the first legal public dance in Elmore City since the town's 1861 founding. The plot of both this movie and its source, 1984's Footloose, were loosely based on Elmore City's story. \n\nCraig Brewer wanted to be a filmmaker after seeing the original Footloose. He loved the movie so much he recorded the audio and listened to it while walking. \n\nDirector Cameo \nCraig Brewer:  His boots are seen dancing in the opening credits when the words &quot;A Craig Brewer Film&quot; appears. \n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nFootloose 2011 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
