Artur is a mysterious man who seems to have a mission of his own in Estonia. The local hardboiled detective Rain firmly believes that Artur is doing some dirty business on his door step. Fascinated by this quiet stranger, Tom helps him to escape from the hospital. Despite Artur's efforts to get rid of the young boy, they end up together like an odd couple. Slowly it becomes obvious that there is some big tragedy in Artur's life. With his charm and innocence Tom seems to ease Artur's pain, caused by his memories. A kind of friendship evolves between these two totally different men. Tom begins to realize that in Artur's life hatred and vengeance are not only words - they are real things, like the war, in which Artur lost his family. An unknown person betrayed him to the Russians, who tortured and killed his family in one of their cleansing operations. Artur fulfills his sad mission after he finally finds out who the traitor was - Kerim, Artur's &quot;brother&quot;, who Artur grew up with. Tom witnesses the murder and is thrown into dramatic events that eventually open his eyes. Tom runs away in terror, discovering that the third &quot;brother&quot;, Gloobus, had set up the family father Kerim. Only Tom knows that Artur had killed the wring man. Tom finds himself an unwitting accomplice in a deadly game of vengeance and death. Facing the violent chain of events only one question remains: will he become a part of it?\n\nTom on 16-aastane eesti poiss, kes kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sib elult tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤pselt nii palju, kui mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµnusaks ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤raolemiseks hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤davajalik. Elul on aga varuks ootamatud pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rded. Tallinna kesklinnas toimuva autoplahvatuse tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµttu satub Tom haiglasse ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hte palatisse tÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡etÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡een Artur Magomajevi, sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµjas perekonna kaotanud kinnise ja karmi mehega. Politsei on veendunud, et Artur peab Eestis tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤itma oma missiooni. Tom aitab tal pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµgeneda. ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œhise kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ttemaksuteekonna jooksul hakkavad ilmsiks tulema Arturi minevikuvarjud. Tomi lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµbusus nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ib tema kaotusvalu kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ll leevendavat, kuid ei lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµpeta vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤givallaahelat, millesse ta poisi paratamatult endaga koos toonud on. Hirmutava tegelikkusega silmitsi olles peavad mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµlemad tegema omad valikud.\n\n\nVisitit my account: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/eestiasi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/eestiasi&lt;/a&gt;      \n\nEstonian music, movies &amp; audiobooks download: &lt;a href=&quot; http://kuldkalake2.co.cc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://kuldkalake2.co.cc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNo credit for me...credit to EVERYONE for sharing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6294fe91a290ecdb99b3adf3d35188c30d4705b","amp;dn":"Vasha.2009.DVDRip.XviD.EST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6294fe91a290ecdb99b3adf3d35188c30d4705b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,41,79,233,26,41,14,205,185,155,58,223,61,53,24,140,48,212,112,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
