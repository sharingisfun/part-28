Inform yourself if or how you're able to run such discs.\nThis will be most likely my last release as a EU release was confirmed :) (and almost everything is working now)\n\nEnjoy!\nDone by Majin Vegeta :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6bfd6b810609f8a35c65550495dc77c3e97434a","amp;dn":"Tales+of+Symphonia+-+Knight+of+Ratatosk+%28Undubbed+v1.1+-+NTSC-U%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6bfd6b810609f8a35c65550495dc77c3e97434a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,191,214,184,16,96,159,138,53,198,85,80,73,93,199,124,62,151,67,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
