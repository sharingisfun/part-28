It didn&amp;#039;t take long before it went down in history as the worst international conflict ever seen, and as in every war before it, it left nothing but questions in its wake. How did it start? How did it sink to the levels it did? Who was to blame, and most importantly, what would the world be like when (or if) we got to the other side of it? \n\n\nThere was never much doubt about what was being fought for or whether victory was worth the price. We fought to destroy a monstrous evil that threatened all civilization, we fought to win and win we did. \n\n\nWWII: Battle for Europe is by no means the entire story of the war. No collection could contain the complete history, with its tragedies and triumphs, miracles and catastrophes. \n\nThe aim here is to cover in words and images the essential history of this greatest of human tragedies, and to re-create the everyday experiences of the people who were swept up by it. \n\nDisc 2: \nAfrica: Our First Offensive \nThe African Campaign \nRommel Routed \nSicily: Operation Husky \n\nGeneral \nComplete name : BFE Part 2.avi \nFile size : 699 MiB \nFormat : Audio Video Interleave \nPlayTime : 1h 13mn \nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release) \nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release \n\nVideo \nCodec : XviD \nFamily : MPEG-4 \nInfo : XviD project \nCodec settings : BVOP \nWidth : 640 \nHeight : 480 \nAspect ratio : 4/3 \nFrame rate : 23.976 fps \n\nAudio \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 \nFamily : MPEG-1 \nCodec profile : Joint stereo \nBit rate : 184 Kbps \nBit rate mode : VBR \nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48 KHz \nResolution : 16 \n\nThis is a 5 Disc set.
