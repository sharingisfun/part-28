That will solve many problems. Also before game start, you can delete the user.ltx too and let the game create a new one based on your system specs.\n\nIf you guys dont have admin priviliges on your pc or dont have UAC disabled, then do not install the game to the default program files directory (its protected by windows)!\nInstall it to an other drive, or an other dir, otherwise you wont be able to save, load, or make screenshots. We will try to find out something for this in the upcoming patch.\n\nAlso you should disable actor legs in options menu, as soon as you can, because it causes 3 troubles: 1 missing step sounds, 2 crash with missing bone, 3 crash when fighting rats.Thanks for your understanding and support!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71db9d0deb39065d124d89689b73fb2984221392","amp;dn":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R._LOST_ALPHA_v1.3000_setup.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71db9d0deb39065d124d89689b73fb2984221392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,219,157,13,235,57,6,93,18,77,137,104,155,115,251,41,132,34,19,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
