His futurist framework merges physics with neuroscience... applied to demonstrations that Ã¢â‚¬Å“show proof-of-principleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in accomplishing what was previously fictional: that minds can be read, memories can be digitally stored, and intelligences can be improved to great extents. The discussion, while heavily scientific, is engaging, clear, and replete with cinematic references... These new mental frontiers make for captivating readingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-Publishers Weekly \n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Facts to ponder: there are as many stars in our galaxy (about 100 billion) as there are neurons in your brain; your cell phone has more computing power than NASA had when it landed Apollo 11 on the moon. These seemingly unrelated facts tell us two things: our brains are magnificently complex organisms, and science fiction has a way of becoming reality rather quickly. This deeply fascinating book by theoretical physicist Kaku explores what might be in store for our minds: practical telepathy and telekinesis; artificial memories implanted into our brains; and a pill that will make us smarter. He describes work being done right now on using sensors to read images in the human brain and on downloading artificial memories into the brain to treat victims of strokes and AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. SF fans might experience a sort of breathless thrill when reading the bookÃ¢â‚¬â€This stuff is happening! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really happening!Ã¢â‚¬â€and for general readers who have never really thought of the brain in all its glorious complexity and potential, the book could be a seriously mind-opening experience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-Booklist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1cdf1cd2f940c88f43ea49637a30a18d0607f55","amp;dn":"Michio+Kaku+-+The+Future+of+the+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1cdf1cd2f940c88f43ea49637a30a18d0607f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,205,241,205,47,148,12,136,244,62,164,150,55,163,10,24,208,96,127,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
