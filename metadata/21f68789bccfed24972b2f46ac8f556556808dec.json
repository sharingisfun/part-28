Whilst retaining a strong interest in classical music, Barbara was captivated by the jazz work of Duke Ellington and John Coltrane and developed a consuming passion for the saxophone. She formed her own group Paraphernalia in 1977. The band, still touring and recording despite Barbara being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1997, became one of the major instrumental attractions on the European concert scene. Barbara's original and inventive compositions and soaring saxophone and flute improvisations, have earned her international acclaim, while the originality of the music has appealed to a wider audience than merely contemporary jazz buffs. ~ Temple Music's website\n\nThis is an important album for me. It represents two and a half years of soul-searching and experimenting, culminating in a broader and more orchestral concept. The use of real strings and brass has benn a delight, as I have always regarded myself as a composer/player rather than a player/composer. I have chosen to use percussion rather than drums and to give much of the rhythmic interest to other instruments. I weave my own improvisations into the fabric of the writing thoughout and there are also improvised solos from Peter Lemer (Extreme jonction and Flights of Fancy) and Paul Dunne (Elysian Fields). The inspiration for the Appia Suite came from five paintings by the Swiss artists Dominique Appia. The multi-layered fantasy, humour and beauty of his work fascinated me and I felt immediately that the pictures would come to life in musical terms. I have echoed his repetition of small motifs and detail by the introduction of recurring musical bridges and themes. In these compositions, space and beauty is of the essence; I would like to feel that you could play this album any time of the night or day and find music to suit your mood. ~ Barbara Thompson\n\nPersonnel:\nBarbara Thompson (Tenor, Alto and Soprano Saxophone, Flute, Piccolo, Clarinet and Keyboards) \nGuy Barker (Trumpet) \nJon Hiseman (Drums and Percussion, Tympani, Gongs) \nStuart Brooks (Trumpet) \nJohn Thirkell (Trumpet) \nBill Geldard (Bass Trombone) \nAndy Pask (Bass Guitar) - 2-10 \nQuentin Williams (Cello) - 2,3,5,8-10 \nDavid Cullen (Keyboards) - 3,6,7 \nPeter Lemer (Keyboards) - 2-4,9 \nPaul Dunne (Guitar) - 1,4,8 \nRod Dorothy (Violin) - 2,7,8,10 \nPatrick Halling (Violin) - 3,5,10 \nRobin Williams (Violin) - 3,5,10\nTony Harris (Viola) - 3,5,10 \nSteve Melling (Keyboards) - 1 \nDave Ball (Bass Guitar) - 1 \n\nAll music composed and arranged by Barbara Thompson \n\nBarbara Thompson - Heavenly Bodies Tracks:\n01 Le grand voyage 5:28 \n02  Extreme jonction 3:55 \n03  Requiem pour deux pilotes 5:18 \n04  Entre les trous de la memoire 5:12 \n05  Les barricades mysterieuses 4:37\n06  Heavenly Bodies 2:32 \n07  Love On The Edge Of Life 4:09 \n08  Elysian Fields 3:07\n09  Flights Of Fancy 6:35 \n10  Tibetan Sunrise 4:51 \n11  Horizons New 3:59 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f68789bccfed24972b2f46ac8f556556808dec","amp;dn":"Barbara+Thompson+-+Heavenly+Bodies+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f68789bccfed24972b2f46ac8f556556808dec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,246,135,137,188,207,237,36,151,43,47,70,172,143,85,101,86,128,141,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
