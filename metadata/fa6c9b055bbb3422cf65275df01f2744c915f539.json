A devoted son of holocaust survivors, ardent critic of Israeli and US Mid-East policies and author of six provocative booksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“including The Holocaust Industry, Beyond Chutzpah and the soon-to-be-released A Farewell to Israel: The Coming Break-Up of American Zionism, Finkelstein has been at the center of many intractable controversies. Called a lunatic and a self-hating Jew by some and an inspirational, street-fighting revolutionary by others, Finkelstein is a deeply polarizing figure whose struggles arise from core questions about freedom, identity and nationhood. Following him as he presents his message to audiences around the globe, American Radical provides an intimate portrait of the man behind the controversy, giving voice to FinkelsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s critics as well as his supporters.\n\n;;\n\nLEARN MORE:\n\nFor more information visit www.americanradicalthefilm.com\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Radical Gift Pack ;;\nDonate $200 to receive the American Radical Pack!\n\n\nGIfts include American Radical on DVD, and the new Link TV tote bag.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa6c9b055bbb3422cf65275df01f2744c915f539","amp;dn":"American+Radical%3A+The+Trials+of+Norman+Finkelstein+%282009%29+LinkTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa6c9b055bbb3422cf65275df01f2744c915f539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,108,155,5,91,187,52,34,207,101,39,93,240,31,39,68,201,21,245,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
