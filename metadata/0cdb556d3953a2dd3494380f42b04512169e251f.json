At the end of this type of dream, half asleep, the events are still for a brief moment taken as real. Then the reactions they give rise to become clearer, more distinct, more reasonable; like on so many mornings the memory of what you drank the night before. Then comes the awareness that it?s all false, that ?it was only a dream,? that the new realities were illusory and you can?t get back into them. Nothing you can hold on to. These dreams are flashes from the unresolved past, flashes that illuminate moments previously lived in confusion and doubt. They provide a blunt revelation of our unfulfilled needs.&quot;\n\n&quot;The only adventure, we said, is to contest the totality, whose center is this way of living, where we can test our strength but never use it. No adventure is directly created for us. The adventures that are presented to us form part of the mass of legends transmitted by the cinema or in other ways; part of the whole spectacular sham of history.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have scarcely begun to make you understand that I don?t intend to play the game.&quot;\n\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cdb556d3953a2dd3494380f42b04512169e251f","amp;dn":"Guy+Debord+-+Critique+de+la+s%C3%A9paration+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cdb556d3953a2dd3494380f42b04512169e251f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,219,85,109,57,83,162,221,52,148,56,15,66,176,69,18,22,158,37,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
