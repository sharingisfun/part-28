They start to produce ceramics again, but without bosses. \n\nNow, they feel free. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found in their work a way to grow humanly. But at the same time, they have to assume a series of responsibilities and challenges. Usually, this provokes serious arguments among them or with themselves. \n\nDuring that process, the workers had to study and to overcome themselves in order to solve all the problems linked to the areas of production. Through the democratic assembly, they found a way to support their organisation and learn how to take their own decisions in the management. \n\nIn a country devastated by an economic debacle, they created two hundred new jobs. Now they are 470 people working in the factory. Together with 5,000 NeuquenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inhabitants who support them, workers have resisted four attempts of evictions. \n\nThey do not consider themselves as the new owners of the ceramic factory: on the contrary, they consider the NeuquÃƒÂ©n community as the only owner. And they give back in donations to the most needed sectors the surplus that the factory produces. \n\nThis is a permanent challenge where every day they have to fight against a political and economic system that tries to boycott them. \n\nTheir biggest obstacle though does not come from the outside. It is about their own fears inculcated by this society. Although many of them do not know it, if they win the battle in their consciences they will open the door to build a completely different world.\n\nZanon factory occupation - interview with workers: http://libcom.org/library/zanon-factory-occupation-interview-with-workers\n\nWikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaSinPat\n\nZanon/Fasinpat website:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/855/0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/855/0/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b255b9ea62628cb813cfd8ce33d3ea9cc08c52bc","amp;dn":"Zanon%3A+Heart+of+the+Factory+%28Corazon+de+Fabrica%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b255b9ea62628cb813cfd8ce33d3ea9cc08c52bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,85,185,234,98,98,140,184,19,207,216,206,51,211,234,156,192,140,82,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
