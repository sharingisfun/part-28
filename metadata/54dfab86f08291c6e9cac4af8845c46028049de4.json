There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid &quot;Na'vi&quot; in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an &quot;avatar&quot; identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora. \n\nUK Release\n\nDisc 1 of 3\n\n3 different cuts on the disc done with seamless branching.\n\nAs listed on the disc menu\n\n1.Original Theatrical Release : needs no explanation\n2.Special Edition Re-Release (with an additional 8 minutes) : the re-release as shown in cinemas recently!!\n3.Collector's Extended Cut (with an additional 16 Minutes) : new and exclusive to this Blu-Ray and DVD too.\n\nThe only Extra's on this disc is direct access to new additional scenes, this is for pretty much a movie only disc.\n\nThe extra English audio tracks are A Dolby Surround mix, Audio Narrative, and a Family Audio track( all objectionable language removed)\n\nDISC INFO:\n\nDisc Title:     AVATAR_CE_D1\nDisc Size:      49,145,121,004 bytes\nProtection:     AACS\nBD-Java:        Yes\nBDInfo:         0.5.6\n\nPLAYLIST REPORT:\n\nName:                   00003.MPLS\nLength:                 2:58:09 (h:m:s)\nSize:                   42,792,327,168 bytes\nTotal Bitrate:          32.03 Mbps\n\nVIDEO:\n\nCodec                   Bitrate             Description    \n-----                   -------             -----------    \nMPEG-4 AVC Video        23542 kbps          1080p / 23.976 fps / 16:9 / High Profile 4.1\n\nAUDIO:\n\nCodec                           Language        Bitrate         Description    \n-----                           --------        -------         -----------    \nDTS-HD Master Audio             English         4133 kbps       5.1 / 48 kHz / 4133 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)\nDolby Digital Audio             English         448 kbps        5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps\nDolby Digital Audio             English         448 kbps        5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps\nDolby Digital Audio             French          448 kbps        5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps\nDolby Digital Audio             Portuguese      448 kbps        5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps\nDolby Digital Audio             Spanish         448 kbps        5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps\nDolby Digital Audio             English         224 kbps        2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / Dolby Surround\n\nSUBTITLES:\n\nCodec                           Language        Bitrate         Description    \n-----                           --------        -------         -----------    \nPresentation Graphics           English         31.198 kbps                    \nPresentation Graphics           English         1.391 kbps                      \nPresentation Graphics           Chinese         15.635 kbps                    \nPresentation Graphics           Chinese         18.286 kbps                    \nPresentation Graphics           French          1.417 kbps                      \nPresentation Graphics           Portuguese      23.770 kbps                    \nPresentation Graphics           Spanish         23.478 kbps                    \nPresentation Graphics           Spanish         1.474 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54dfab86f08291c6e9cac4af8845c46028049de4","amp;dn":"Avatar+Extended+Collectors+Edition+2010+1080p+Blu-ray+AVC+DTS-HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54dfab86f08291c6e9cac4af8845c46028049de4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,223,171,134,240,130,145,198,233,202,196,175,136,69,196,96,40,4,157,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
