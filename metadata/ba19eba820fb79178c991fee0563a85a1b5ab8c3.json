With more than 20 years in the food industry, Matt is on a road trip to meet the best growers and farmers in Australia. Once he's got his hands on their produce, he'll turn it into a mouth-watering dish. In this series, Matt clocks up more than 20,000km in search of culinary treasures, travelling through the stunning landscape of South Australia and Western Australia. From the blustering coastline of the Eyre Peninsula to the red dirt and big skies of the Kimberley, Matt discovers a vast spread of unique and exciting produce and the food heroes who farm it.\n\n\n\n\nPaddock to Plate - Season 2, Episode 1\n\n\n\nEyre Peninsula, SA\n\nMatt Moran travels to South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, a region of both untamed coastline and harsh, arid desert. Local sheep graze on the area's saltbush, becoming a meat flavoured from the inside out. Building on the salt theme, Matt bakes the lamb in a salt crust pastry. South in Port Lincoln, it's time to learn how to catch squid, then on to Coffin Bay for oysters. Thanks to Matt, blue fin tuna is on the menu for lucky racegoers at The Kimba Cup race day.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 03-Sep-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba19eba820fb79178c991fee0563a85a1b5ab8c3","amp;dn":"Paddock.to.Plate.S02E01.PDTV.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba19eba820fb79178c991fee0563a85a1b5ab8c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,25,235,168,32,251,121,23,140,153,31,238,5,99,168,90,27,90,184,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
