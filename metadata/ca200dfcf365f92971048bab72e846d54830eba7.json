ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has the lyrical prowess that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s known for, however backed by a rather aggressive orchestral beats. That isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the only song on here that caught my attention: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack and BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is backed by a rather hip-pop score, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPalm of Your HandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a driving rock song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ each of which contain rather bleak, emotional lyrics. The last half of this album is rather strong; Human AgainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s first single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGhostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a light, relaxing pop song that should have no problem climbing Vh1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s music show.\n\nAlthough the nice, light, poppy songs throughout the album are nice, Michaelson really excels in the slow ballads. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m ThroughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow We LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are two beautiful, flowing soft songs, each really showcases IngridÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing skills and amazing voice. My favorite track on the album is the second to last ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeep Warm,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which sounds like the perfect song that anyone can put onto a Winter season mixtape for your respective loved one.\n\nThere are a couple of tracks that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really grab me (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the SeaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), but that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take away from how catchy Human Again is. This is an album that could finally put her on the commercial level that Barielles and Perri are on right now, which I feel is well deserved and now a bit overdue. Human Again is a relaxing, emotional, and well delivered album, from front to back.\n\ncd ripped by EAC \n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/11/ingrid-michaelson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/11/ingrid-michaelson/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca200dfcf365f92971048bab72e846d54830eba7","amp;dn":"Ingrid+Michaelson...Human+Again%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca200dfcf365f92971048bab72e846d54830eba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,32,13,252,243,101,249,41,113,4,139,171,114,232,70,213,72,48,235,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
