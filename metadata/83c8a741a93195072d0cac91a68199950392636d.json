During that first period of Aherusia, Voreas Faethon was the main vocalist and also played the bass.\nThe aesthetic principles, the band holds until the present day, were forged from the combination of the traditional hellenic sound and the progregorian european folkloric tunes under the music manifest of Majestic Black Metal. The band played some underground shows and released independently the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whispers of MoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mini LP in 1999 for a very small number of copies.\nDuring 2000-2003 the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activity was frozen, the first line up broke and Voreas Faethon entered the cult north aegean black metal band of Panselinos (based in Mytilene, Lesvos and originally created by Orion Arctorios).\nEventually in 2004 the Aherusian dawnhost gathered again:\nFrom the ashes of Panselinos, Aherusia were formed again with the following line up:\nOrion Arctorios~vocals, bass.\nVoreas Faethon~guitars.\nArcania~guitars.\nIerax~cretian lyra.\nIchoria~Keyboards.\nPolypimon Damnameneus~battery.\nTwo years later, an unsuccessful recording of the first album and too many shows across the entire Aegean Sea, Polypimon Damnameneus and Ichoria left the band, to be succeeded from Aidhor and Charon.\nIn 2007 the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat returned back to Athens, where Alchemist an Esperos took the orphaned positions of Orion Arctorios and Ierax, since they could not follow the band due to serious obligations. In early 2009, Shadow was chosen to be the bass player replacing Alchemist.\n\nThe present day, Aherusia are promoting their debut Ã¢â‚¬Å“And The Tides Shall Reveal The TracesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,prepare their second album Ã¢â‚¬Å“As I Cross The Seas Of My SoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and are also booking shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83c8a741a93195072d0cac91a68199950392636d","amp;dn":"Aherusia+-+And+The+Tides+Shall+Reveal+The+Traces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83c8a741a93195072d0cac91a68199950392636d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,200,167,65,169,49,149,7,45,12,172,145,166,129,153,149,3,146,99,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
