It's a whole lot of fun, and actually more varied than one might think. Among the highlights are the iconic &quot;Sun Brimmer's Blues,&quot; the kazoo-led &quot;Mississippi River Waltz,&quot; the hardly subtle &quot;She Stabbed Me with an Ice-Pick,&quot; and the accomplished and haunting &quot;Fourth Street Mess&quot; by the Memphis Jug Band, and three classic sides from the Jug Stompers, &quot;Minglewood Blues,&quot; the bubbly &quot;Feather Bed,&quot; and &quot;Viola Lee Blues.&quot; More kazoos, jugs and banjos than you can shake a stick at, with great vocals and solid songs.
