This book was written by Dr. Hubert Benoit, who was a man with an extremely rare gift of intuition when it comes to identifying and understanding the nature of God and metaphysics, and that of the human psychological condition, and importantly, how they are intended to interact with one another.  \n\n\tThe subject matter of this book has already been widely written about and discussed.  However, viewpoints vary wildly as we know, and it is rare to come across an individual who happens to possess a clear and penetrating understanding of the fundamental truths concerning the metaphysical realm.  Here, however, we have such a man in Hubert Benoit.  This is a bold statement, but a person who has had the opportunity to read Dr. Benoit's words will tell you the same thing.  Aldous Huxley himself speaks to this in a letter which he wrote to Dr. Benoit after reading his first book titled 'Metaphysics and Psychoanalysis' where he wrote: &quot;A book like yours foreshadows, at last, for a true science of the psychology of man. Until now we have only had partial glimpses.&quot;\n\n\tDr. Benoit was a practicing psychiatrist for over 35 years and also authored the book 'Zen and the Psychology of Transformation: The Supreme Doctrine', as well as other books about psychology and metaphysics.  This book was his final literary work.  Not only is he a man of keen metaphysical intuition, but he is a gifted and highly experienced psychologist as well.  I encourage you to take a look at this book for yourself, it is truly a diamond in the rough that the whole world should have the opportunity to see. \n\n\nThe Author's introduction from the book:\n\n\tThe essential subject of this book is our human condition, the possibility of our metaphysical transformation and the understanding of what leads to this transformation. \n\n\tAs soon as you begin reading, you will probably be very surprised at some of my views on the genesis of the cosmos, views inspired by Traditional Metaphysics. Mankind is part of the cosmos and shares its genesis. Therefore, the knowledge of this genesisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as you will see later onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½projects on the functioning of the human being some extremely unexpected and paradoxical laws that are contrary to current opinion. \n\n\tWhat is of utmost importance to usÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as we areÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is that which concerns us personally, and in particular that which can deliver us from the painful slavery we undergo. \n\n\tI hope that you will not be put off or let yourself be discouraged by the pure metaphysical abstraction that is found at the beginning of this book because this abstraction is necessary to the knowledge and understanding of our condition such as it truly is.\n\n\nContents: \n\nPart One: The Metaphysical Domain\n- Metaphysical Views\n- Validity of Our Intellect in the Metaphysical Domain\n- The Noumenal Domain\n- The Creative Principle\n- The Nature of God\n\nPart Two: Cosmic and Human Phenomenology\n- PhenomenaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Are They Real?\n- Why God Manifests Himself\n- Two Views of the Cosmos\n- Genesis of Creation\n- The Duality of Purusha-Prakriti\n- The Divine Indifference\n- The Law of Interconditionment\n- The Total Conditioning of the Human Being\n- The Mission of the Demiurge\n- God and Humanity\n\nPart Three: Agony and the Death of Human Egotism\n- Critique of Systematic Processes\n- Theoretical Intellectual Comprehension and Knowledge True to Life\n- The Death-in-Order-to-be-Reborn \n\nPart Four: Humility and the Access to Deliverance\n- The Search for the Absolute Good\n- Duality and Dualism: Possibility of Perfect Humility\n- Good and Evil\n- Conditioning of the Realization\n- The Progressive Diminution of Pride\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f47364a70efa8d44fdc0500381f6e417991320","amp;dn":"The+Interior+Realization+-+Hubert+Benoit+%28+Zen+%2F+Psychology+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f47364a70efa8d44fdc0500381f6e417991320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,244,115,100,167,14,250,141,68,253,192,80,3,129,246,228,23,153,19,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
