It all feels like a sign that something awful is coming.\n\nAnne Fitzgerald, a former nun turned private investigator, is hired by the Archdiocese of Boston to investigate the immaculate conceptions. Even as she comes to care about and trust the young women, she realizes that both are in great danger. Terrifying forces of light and darkness are gathering. Stepping into uncharted territory where the unknown is just the beginning, Anne must discover the truth--to save the young women, to save herself, and to protect the future of all mankind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7822ec1060dda659b7ff9221e4f448f955b3b825","amp;dn":"Cradle+and+All+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7822ec1060dda659b7ff9221e4f448f955b3b825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,34,236,16,96,221,166,89,183,255,146,33,228,244,72,249,85,179,184,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
