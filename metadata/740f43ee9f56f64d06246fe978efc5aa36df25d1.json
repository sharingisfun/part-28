He was suspected, but never charged, in two other murders which occurred in Conroe, Texas, with his accomplice Jason Burkett. Perry was convicted 10 years earlier of the October 2001 murder, apparently committed in order to steal a car for a joyride. Perry denies that he was responsible for the killings, blaming Burkett (also appearing in the film) who was convicted of the other two murders. Burkett, who received a lesser life sentence for his involvement, likewise blames Perry.[1]\n\nPerry's final interviews for the film were recorded only 8 days before his execution[1] on July 1, 2010.[2] The film also includes interviews with victims' families and law enforcement officers.[6]\n\nBurkett's wife appears in the film, a free woman who met and married Burkett after his conviction. They were only allowed contact by holding hands under guarded supervision, but she claims to be pregnant with his child.[2]\n\nThe film does not focus on Perry's guilt or innocence, and has a minimal amount of narration, with Herzog, unlike in many of his films, never appearing onscreen.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Used\n\n\n\nINTO_THE_ABYSS-2011-DVDSCR MKV............Thanks\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:740f43ee9f56f64d06246fe978efc5aa36df25d1","amp;dn":"The+Abyss+2011+DVDSCR+XViD+DTRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"740f43ee9f56f64d06246fe978efc5aa36df25d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,15,67,238,159,86,246,77,6,36,111,233,120,239,197,170,54,223,37,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
