He is also one of the co-founders and co-directors of the annual Jaipur Literature Festival.[1][2][3] In 2012 he was appointed Whitney J. Oates Visiting Fellow in the Humanities by Princeton University.\n\n\n Sparkling with irrepressible wit, City of Djinns peels back the layers of Delhi's centuries-old history, revealing an extraordinary array of characters along the way-from eunuchs to descendants of great Moguls. With refreshingly open-minded curiosity, William Dalrymple explores the seven &quot;dead&quot; cities of Delhi as well as the eighth cityÃ¢â‚¬â€today's Delhi. Underlying his quest is the legend of the djinns, fire-formed spirits that are said to assure the city's Phoenix-like regeneration no matter how many times it is destroyed. Entertaining, fascinating, and informative, City of Djinns is an irresistible blend of research and adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8e53c0f8397d98609ba36dd1f1f744fba8d196","amp;dn":"%5BTravel%5D+City+of+Djinns+-+A+Year+in+Delhi+by+William+Dalrymple+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8e53c0f8397d98609ba36dd1f1f744fba8d196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,142,83,192,248,57,125,152,96,155,163,109,209,241,247,68,251,168,209,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
