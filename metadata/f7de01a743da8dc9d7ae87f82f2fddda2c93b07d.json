All files present, all integrity checks valid as of given date and PKGBUILD versions.\n\nIncludes BOTH an archive and an extracted folder. DO NOT download both. The 7z archive is for people who need all fonts, and is much smaller than the extracted files. The extracted files are for people who are missing only one or two fonts and need to make up the difference.\n\nYou can transition from leeching to seeding by extracting the 7z and then checking the extracted folder in your torrent client. It will check the integrity of the extracted files and start seeding them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7de01a743da8dc9d7ae87f82f2fddda2c93b07d","amp;dn":"AUR+ttf-ms-win8+6.3.9600.16384-1+%2810%2F2013%29+fonts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7de01a743da8dc9d7ae87f82f2fddda2c93b07d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,222,1,167,67,218,141,201,215,174,135,248,47,47,221,218,44,147,176,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
