The setting is some time in the future in Tokyo, after a large disaster that has left the city in some disarray.\n\nPresumably, Sarah Pezzini of the comic book, and American TV series is long gone, and the Witchblade has chosen a new bearer, Masane Amou. She&amp;#039;s a young, scatter-brained, single mother trying to look after her daughter Rihoko. A governmental child welfare agency is after Masane because they claim she is an unfit parent and want to take Rihoko away. They may have more in mind than the welfare of the child, however.\n\nMasane must also learn to control this new force whose origin is unknown to her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a57195e21510642fb9cf851ed49aa1ebe4f0a0","amp;dn":"Witchblade+Anime+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a57195e21510642fb9cf851ed49aa1ebe4f0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,165,113,149,226,21,16,100,47,185,207,133,30,212,154,161,235,228,240,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
