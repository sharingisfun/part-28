It starts off a bit slow, but picks up and becomes hysterically funny... I mean, the show has a body count, lol.\n\nThe Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created and originally written by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen. Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas, the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.\n\nThe show ran for seven series and 53 episodes Ã¢â‚¬â€ including two Christmas specials Ã¢â‚¬â€ from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series, after which they left the show.\n\nThe Brittas Empire enjoyed a long and successful run throughout the 1990s, and gained itself large mainstream audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's Britain's Best Sitcom poll,[1] and all series have been released on DVD.\n\nThe creators Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen often combine farce with either surreal or dramatic elements in episodes. For example in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to become electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in The Brittas Empire.\n\n This is ripped from the new DVD set that was released last month. It is converted to MP4 with no compression, hence the large files. Up until now it was only available on a torrent with low res files, but it was enough to make me seek this dvd set out. I will be uploading all seven series as well as the dvd extras","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:281faa42490a361354501b771f45897791db41a9","amp;dn":"The+Brittas+Empire+Series+5+-+Uncompressed+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"281faa42490a361354501b771f45897791db41a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,31,170,66,73,10,54,19,84,80,27,119,31,69,137,119,145,219,65,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
