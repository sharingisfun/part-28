Glories (Author), A. Maujean (Author), Denis Dubourdieu (Author), Pascal Ribereau-Gayon (Author), D. Dubourdieu (Author), A. Maugean (Author) \n\n\nThe transformation of grapes into wine has been the focus of much scientific research for centuries. It was not until the nineteenth century that the role of yeasts in alcoholic fermentation was discovered.\n\nSince this discovery the findings of chemists, biochemists and microbiologists have led to controlled conditions in winemaking, producing more varied and higher quality wines.\n\nThe Handbook of Enology Volume 2: The Chemistry of Wine Stabilization and Treatments uniquely combines chemical theory with the descriptions of day-to-day work in the latter stages of winemaking from clarification and stabilization treatments to ageing processes in vats and barrels. This book discusses the scientific basics and technological problems of winemaking and the resulting consequences for the practitioner, providing an authoritative and complete reference manual for both the winemaker and the student.\n\nThis text will be invaluable to winemakers, students of enology or vinification and chemists interested in winemaking.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3ea80f09d726fb01b4476718132db02feaedca","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+of+Enology+v++2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3ea80f09d726fb01b4476718132db02feaedca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,62,168,15,9,215,38,251,1,180,71,103,24,19,45,176,47,234,237,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
