This is no mere textbook and factual history of art, nor a subjective appreciation. It is an exquisite balance of informative detail and thoughtful interpretation, whereby the author proves herself both artist and scholar.\r\nThe volume is divided into two sections, the first dealing with the history of sculpture and its development; the second telling what is known of the sculptors and their works.\r\n\r\nThere are over 700 half-tone illustrations.\r\n\r\nGisela M. A. Richter was Curator of the Department of Classical Art at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1925 to 1948","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e38cf987175655d460d9e4142a5798a17164ba51","amp;dn":"The+sculpture+and+sculptors+of+the+Greeks+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e38cf987175655d460d9e4142a5798a17164ba51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,140,249,135,23,86,85,212,96,217,228,20,42,87,152,161,113,100,186,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
