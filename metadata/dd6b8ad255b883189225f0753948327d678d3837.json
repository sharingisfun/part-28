But the Econosphere works best if we understand what nurtures itÃ¢â‚¬â€œand what poisons it. In The Econosphere, leading economist Craig Thomas reveals the amazing economic organism we re all part of, explains how it really works, and shows how to make it start working againÃ¢â‚¬â€œfor everyone. Thomas illuminates the laws that govern every economic decision you makeÃ¢â‚¬â€œand shows how to use that information to make better decisions, achieve greater success, and maximize your happiness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd6b8ad255b883189225f0753948327d678d3837","amp;dn":"The+Econosphere%3A+What+Makes+the+Economy+Really+Work%2C+How+to+Prot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd6b8ad255b883189225f0753948327d678d3837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,107,138,210,85,184,131,24,146,37,240,117,57,72,50,125,103,141,56,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
