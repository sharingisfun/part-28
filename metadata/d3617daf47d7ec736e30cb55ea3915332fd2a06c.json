The recent discovery that the famous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHitler's skullÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Moscow is female, as well as newly uncovered documents, provide powerful proof for their case. Dunstan and Williams cite people, places, and dates in over 500 detailed notes that identify the plan's escape route, vehicles, aircraft, U-boats, and hideouts. Among the details: the CIA's possible involvement and Hitler's life in Patagonia--including his two daughters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3617daf47d7ec736e30cb55ea3915332fd2a06c","amp;dn":"Grey+Wolf+-+The+Escape+of+Adolf+Hitler+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3617daf47d7ec736e30cb55ea3915332fd2a06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,97,125,175,71,215,236,115,110,48,203,85,234,57,21,51,47,210,160,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
