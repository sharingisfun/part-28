Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.\n\nTo prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I have wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends and collect them all.  :D\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\nEarly Music at Wik (Joculatores Upsalienses)\nThe Four Seasons (Joculatores Upsalienses)\nWoods, Women &amp; Wine (Joculatores Upsalienses)\nEnglish Songs of the Middle Ages (Sequentia Ensemble)\nThe Ancient Miracles (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)\n\nAll are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f30180963d3f1ec761d83edd9251417c7c8aec","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f30180963d3f1ec761d83edd9251417c7c8aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,243,1,128,150,61,63,30,199,97,216,62,221,146,81,65,124,124,138,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
