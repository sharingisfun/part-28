The song's jealousy theme was re-visited in other Lennon compositions, such as &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; and &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;. Lennon played the guitar solo, which he also conceived. Influenced by the then relatively unknown Wilson Pickett, the song is rooted in the twelve-bar blues form, with Lennon introducing a discordant Sharp 9th (F) on the D7th chord, pointedly emphasising &quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦I told you beforeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; and then pushing this note for the exasperated &quot;Oh!&quot; before resolving to the song's key of G.[8] The song reflected Lennon's love for hard-edged American R&amp;B Ã¢â‚¬â€ &quot;a cowbell going four in the bar and the chord going chatoong!&quot; as he put it.\n\nWith filming due to begin on A Hard Day's Night film director Dick Lester needed the Beatles to provide him with original material ahead of production and &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; was selected as part of the Scala Theatre &quot;live performance&quot; scene in the film, but was dropped for the final cut along with &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; and &quot;I Call Your Name.&quot; The recording took nine takes to complete, and was considered for the A-side of their next single until McCartney wrote &quot;Can't Buy Me Love.&quot;\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can't_Do_That&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can't_Do_That&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KanagAaeo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KanagAaeo&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:32\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
