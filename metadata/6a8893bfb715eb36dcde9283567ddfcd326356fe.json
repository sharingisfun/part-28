There was this kind of collective herding mentality.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBut historian Howard Zinn goes on to recall: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy early memories of the Depression were seeing my mother standing on one of these lines to get food ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I [also] felt very ashamed walking down the street to school and there was my father, selling neckties on the street. To this day, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m ashamed of my own reaction.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe Great Depression asks why so many people trusted the stock market? At what point did the market lose touch with reality? And did the USÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attempts to rescue the economy directly lead to the rise of Nazism in Germany?\n\nIt also asks whether military expenditure was the only way out of the downturn and finally, it poses the question: have todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leaders learned enough from this crisis?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8893bfb715eb36dcde9283567ddfcd326356fe","amp;dn":"1929%2C+The+Great+Depression","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8893bfb715eb36dcde9283567ddfcd326356fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,136,147,191,183,21,235,54,220,222,146,131,86,125,223,205,50,99,86,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
