Originally, it came in a three CD set, the third, bonus CD being a recording on 27 June 2000 at the Portland BBC Radio Theatre. Later editions contain only the first two CDs.  The first pressing mistakenly included the second (disc 2, track 12) version of the song &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; twice on disc two, missing the first (disc 2, track 4) version. EMI declined to issue corrected replacement discs to customers, instead mailing out one-song CDRs of the first version.  This compilation also features a previously unreleased song, &quot;Looking For A Friend&quot; (disc 1, track 15), which John Peel says would be released as a single by Arnold Corns as a follow-up to the Arnold Corns versions of &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; and &quot;Hang Onto Yourself&quot;, but it was never released, thus making this the only performance of &quot;Looking For A Friend&quot;..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] In the Heat of the Morning&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n[02] London Bye Ta Ta&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:36\n[03] Karma Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n[04] Silly Boy Blue&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:08   \n[05] Let Me Sleep Beside You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n[06] Janine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n[07] Amsterdam&quot; (Jacques Brel) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18        \n[08] God Knows I'm Good&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n[09] The Width of a Circle&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:21\n[10] Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n[11] Cygnet Committee&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 9:07\n[12] Memory of a Free Festival&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n[13] Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:55    \n[14] Bombers&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:19\n[15] Looking for a Friend&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n[16] Almost Grown&quot; (Chuck Berry) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n[17] Kooks&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:32\n[18] It Ain't Easy&quot; (Ron Davies) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:51\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - h:m:s\nTracks 1 to 4 recorded for John Peel in Top Gear as &quot;David Bowie and the Tony Visconti Orchestra,&quot; 13 May 1968, tracks 1-3 broadcast 26 May 1968.\nTracks 5 and 6 recorded for D.L.T.
