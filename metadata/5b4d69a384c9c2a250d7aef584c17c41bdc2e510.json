ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a newfound sense of purpose that makes DeftonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sixth album stand out. The band recorded the album after their best friend and bassist Chi Cheng sustained a debilitating brain injury from a car accident in November of 2008. The tangle of Stephen CarpenterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s woozy, undulating guitar work and MorenoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soaring then secretive vocal style is the bittersweet dynamic behind each of DeftonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ records, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Diamond Eyes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ The friction drives the music as much as it does the players, though it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always make life easy for childhood friends Carpenter and Moreno. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“What makes us work?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ asks Carpenter. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Chino will give you the exact opposite answer that I do. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the way it is with us-we contradict each other constantly but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also what makes our music what it is-intense and different.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n01 diamond eyes\n02 royal\n03 cmnd-ctrl\n04 youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen the butcher\n05 beauty school\n06 prince\n07 rocket skates\n08 sextape\n09 risk\n10 976-evil\n11 this place is death \n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/watching3vemq8.gif[/IMG]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4d69a384c9c2a250d7aef584c17c41bdc2e510","amp;dn":"Deftones_-_Diamond_Eyes-2010%28split+tracks%2Bcover%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4d69a384c9c2a250d7aef584c17c41bdc2e510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,77,105,163,132,201,194,162,80,215,174,245,132,193,124,65,189,194,229,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
