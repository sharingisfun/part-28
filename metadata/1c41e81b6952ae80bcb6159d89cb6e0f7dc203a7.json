Having disposed of the pursuit of the overtly graphic showcase or complex personality examination, it goes without saying this mystery had better be pretty damn entertaining. And in truth, it is. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superior to plenty of efforts IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen in the past. For a low-budget creeper, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a solid piece of work that features some spirited efforts from a diverse group of individuals.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 704x400 - 23.976fps - 1h 29mn 23s 283ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c41e81b6952ae80bcb6159d89cb6e0f7dc203a7","amp;dn":"Death+Do+Us+Part+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c41e81b6952ae80bcb6159d89cb6e0f7dc203a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,65,232,27,105,82,174,128,188,182,21,157,137,203,110,15,125,194,3,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
