Because it is the real truth. But please don't ask me about, I will not cross that line. All that I will say is that when running away they pictured me and I will be fined (because the speed).\nNow is here and is for you. Enjoy it.\n\nRemember that this and the other La Edad de Oro recordings are more than 25 years old. Screenshots talk by herself about the quality. Anyway some recordings have more quality than others. MPEG Streamclip detects audio as stereo, I don't want to start another time\ntalking about stereo, mono or dual mono, this is what it is, that's all.\n\nThis STOLEN FILES series will include most of the LA EDAD DE ORO shows not rebroacast back in 2006, all of them shared by me here 3 years ago. Also will include 2 upgrades for the Psychedelic Furs and The Sound gigs (not rebroadcast but shared from other sources).\n\nAll the STOLEN FILES DVDs will share the same authoring, and all the artwork will use the same template inspired in the X FILES tv series. The artwork at full size will be always included, but feel free to share your own creation.\n\nDon't ask me, share it in any place you want but, please, credit the source.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thunders.ca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thunders.ca/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.johnnythunders.org/project.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.johnnythunders.org/project.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSupport the artists!
