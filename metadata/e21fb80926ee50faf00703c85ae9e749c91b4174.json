Kinshasa is an inviting place. With petrol in short supply in DRC's capital, he and his sidekick pursue a plot to get hold of a secret cache - barrels of fuel they can sell for a huge profit. Of course they're not the only ones who want the stuff. Cesar is a ruthless, sharply dressed foreigner thriving in Kinshasa's lawless streets. A female military officer joins the fray. Even the church will betray its tenets for a piece of the action. But Riva's main nemesis is Azor, a crime boss in the classic style: big, decadent and brutal. He's not a man to mess with, but his girlfriend, Nora, may just be the most seductive woman in all of DRC. Riva catches sight of her dancing at a nightclub and it's not long before Nora matches the fuel cache as a coveted object of his lust. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21fb80926ee50faf00703c85ae9e749c91b4174","amp;dn":"Viva+Riva%21+%282010%29+eng%2C+fre%2C+ptbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21fb80926ee50faf00703c85ae9e749c91b4174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,31,184,9,38,238,80,250,240,7,3,200,90,233,231,73,201,27,65,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
