What does it have to do with the stranger, who survived a terrible crash, only to sit and mutter the farm's name? And if the place is supposed to be deserted, what do you keep seeing out of the corner of your eye?\n\nInstall:\n========\nPreCracked, so just run Setup!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d1ede6b221b3f2ae68e5d841c96bcba1f2953b","amp;dn":"Corrosion-Cold+Winter+Waiting+-+TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d1ede6b221b3f2ae68e5d841c96bcba1f2953b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,209,237,230,178,33,179,242,174,104,229,216,65,201,107,203,161,242,149,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
