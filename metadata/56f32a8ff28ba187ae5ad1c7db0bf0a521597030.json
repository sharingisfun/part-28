There are some typos and discrepancies, I think when I formatted it to publish, it messed it up. There is some M/M and F/M erotica in my book. But please read it and enjoy. I would appreciate comments so I know what people think of my book. Thank you.\nQivorose\n\nQuick description, there is a total of 10 short stories that I intend to actually make in to novels. I have a variety of story lines, characters and genres. From Phoenixes and Angels, Greater beings and normal humans, magic fairies and dragons royalty and betrayal, super humans with mutations and group marriage and different forms of polygamy, other dimensional creatures attacking creatures and mysterious reappearances of missing people, memories of a life not your own and biological terrorist attacks that turn humans in to zombie like creatures, Fallen goddesses and destined warriors, my own form of post apocalyptic world and a new government within it, magic and action in the form of a very odd and agile family, and a mystery involving a girl and an inheritance that she knew nothing about form a relative she barely knows, her attempted murder will come after in novel.\n\nWell I know my description leaves a lot wanting but I hope it at least got some of you interested. If you have a problem downloading it I also have it up on my wetpaint website to read for free, here is that website.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mystories.wetpaint.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mystories.wetpaint.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank you for the interest and please leave me feedback and comments. Have a nice day and enjoy\n\nok I had to re-upload the file because the PDF file was not complete. I hope it works now. Sorry for all the hassle, this is my first torrent upload and I am having difficulties with it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f32a8ff28ba187ae5ad1c7db0bf0a521597030","amp;dn":"A+Collection+of+short+stories+-+Gloria+Viotti+Olson+%28some+M%2FM%2C+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f32a8ff28ba187ae5ad1c7db0bf0a521597030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,243,42,143,242,139,161,135,174,90,209,199,219,11,240,165,33,89,112,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
