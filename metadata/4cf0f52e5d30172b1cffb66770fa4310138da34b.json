Originally formed in 1999 only to disband five years later, the band leaves rather a lasting impression with their unique sound.  Loud guitar noise of epic proportions and experimental electronica create lush sounds while the vocalist tells stories with her lovely soft voice.  Featuring the dreamy electro chill of &quot;Delay-Decay-Attack&quot; and the soaringly intense rock song &quot;Blindspot/Invisible Bend,&quot; Meanwhile, Back in Communist Russia just may be the coolest band you've never heard of.\n\n01.
