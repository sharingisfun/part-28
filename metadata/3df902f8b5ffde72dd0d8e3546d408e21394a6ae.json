Left with the care of her family home, she has trouble meeting the mortgage payments and her ex-boyfriend is the bank manager attempting to foreclose. When she takes in boarders to meet expenses, she unwittingly rents a room to an international criminal hiding out from a bounty hunter, John Flynn. When the bounty hunter shows up, the criminal takes a hike. Reluctantly admitting that he might need her help, Flynn agrees to make Sara a partner for half the bounty if they catch the missing man in time. What follows is a wild ride where Sara discovered that she is anything but boring and predictable. \n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df902f8b5ffde72dd0d8e3546d408e21394a6ae","amp;dn":"The+Awakening+1994+%5BHarlequin%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df902f8b5ffde72dd0d8e3546d408e21394a6ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,249,2,248,181,255,222,114,221,13,142,53,70,212,8,226,19,148,166,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
