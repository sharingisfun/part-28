Four months after the tragic car accident that killed their parents, Elena Gilbert 17 years, (Nina Dobrev) and her brother 15 years, Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) are still trying to cope with their grief and move on with their lives. Elena has always been the star student; beautiful, popular and involved with school and friends, but now she finds herself struggling to hide her sadness from the world. As the school year begins, Elena and her friends are fascinated by a handsome and mysterious new student, Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley). Stefan and Elena are immediately drawn to one another, and Elena has no way of knowing that Stefan is a centuries-old vampire, struggling to live peacefully among humans, while his brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder) is the embodiment of vampire violence and brutality. Now these two vampire brothers - one good, one evil - are at war for Elena's soul and for the souls of her friends, family and all the residents of the small town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. \n\nOriginal title: The Vampire Diaries S05\nCreator: LJ Smith \nRelease Date in Brazil: 2014 \nDuration: 42 minutes per episode +/- \nGenre: Drama | Mystery | Adventure | Thriller \nImdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1405406/ \n\nSize: 21 GB \nFile Extension: .ISO \nVideo Quality: DVD-R \nVideo Codec: H.264 / AVC \nAudio Codec: AC3 5.1 / AC3 2.0 \nResolution: 853 x 480 \nAudio Language: Portuguese / English \nSubtitles: Portuguese \n\n\n\n\nSEED PLEASE\n\nENJOY...\n\n\n\n=====================================================\nW W W .
