Unlike traditional shoot em' ups, where the direction of the player craft is fixed, Luftrausers allows 360 degrees of motion, more akin to a multidirectional shooter. However, the player's main weapon can only fire from the front, forcing the player to take into account the position and angle of the airplane. There is no health bar: player health is indicated by a circle around the aircraft that shrinks as damage increases. Aircraft can be customized with dozens of combinations of engines, weapons, and hulls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd76254ac82d30709d239451c922716908b32bb","amp;dn":"%28Score%29+Luftrausers+2011-2014+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd76254ac82d30709d239451c922716908b32bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,215,98,84,172,130,211,7,9,210,57,69,28,146,39,22,144,139,50,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
