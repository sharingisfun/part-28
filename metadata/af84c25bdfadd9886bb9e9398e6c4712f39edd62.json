The Sri Lankan-born graphic designer and cook started this book as a series of hand-drawn recipes that he made for his sons to cook from when he was going away for a few weeks. Then came MasterChef, where Kumar was one of the most popular contestants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ever! Kumar's Family Cookbook features simple yet luscious recipes, many inspired by the cuisine of his native Sri Lanka, as well as beautiful drawings, family anecdotes, and photos.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s27.postimg.org/al1ms3wmb/kumar.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s27.postimg.org/al1ms3wmb/kumar.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kumarpereira.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kumarpereira.net/&lt;/a&gt;\nBorn in Sri Lanka, Kumar Pereira studied typographic design at the London College of Printing.
