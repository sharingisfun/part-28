A limited edition was released featuring a bonus DVD with the video &quot;Magical Backstage Tour 2009&quot; (videos of recording sessions, live footage of their performance at Summer Sonic 09 and more).\n\nIt was preceded by two singles: &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu/Dive&quot; and &quot;My Lonely Town.&quot; &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu&quot; was used as the Fuji Television drama Buzzer Beat's theme song, and &quot;Dive&quot; was used as a CM song for the Suzuki Swift advertising campaign. The album track &quot;Pray&quot; served as the theme to the Japanese film Tajomaru, which was released to Japanese theaters in September 2009. On the release date of the album, it was reported that another album track, &quot;Long Time No See,&quot; would serve as the theme to Salaryman Kintaro 2, which is set to begin airing in January 2010 on TV Asahi.\n\nMagic debuted at No. 1 on the Japanese Oricon weekly album charts with its initial week sales of around 341,000 copies. The album became their 24th number-one album on Oricon charts.
