Noire is a video game developed by Team Bondi in conjunction with Rockstar Games[10] and published by Rockstar Games. Initially announced as a PlayStation 3 exclusive, the game was later reported to also be scheduled for release on the Xbox 360.[4][11] L.A. Noire is set in &quot;a perfectly re-created Los Angeles&quot; of 1947,[12] with players being given an open-ended challenge to solve a series of murder mysteries.[11]\n\n\n\n\nAs the title suggests, the game draws heavily from both plot and aesthetic elements of film noir - stylistic films from the 1940s and 1950s that shared similar visual styles and themes including crime, sex and moral ambiguity and were often shot in black and white with harsh, low-key lighting. The game uses a distinctive colouring-style in homage to the visual style of film noir. The post-war setting is the backdrop for plot elements that reference the detective films of the '40s (as well as James Ellroy's novel L.A. Confidential and the Academy Award winning Curtis Hanson film based on it), such as corruption and drugs, with a jazz soundtrack.\n\n\n\n\nL.A. Noire is also notable for using Lightsprint's real-time global illumination technology, as well as Depth Analysis's newly developed technology for the film and video game industries called MotionScan, where actors are recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle.\n\n\n\n\nLA Noire is the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\nseed comment n enjoy!!!...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8d6ad984b2de82313acbffab4dbd7022e9ec78","amp;dn":"LA+Noire+%5BMULTI5%5D%5BDVD1%5D%5BRegion+Free%5D%5BXBOX360%5D%5Bsneak_shot%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8d6ad984b2de82313acbffab4dbd7022e9ec78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,141,106,217,132,178,222,130,49,58,203,255,171,77,189,112,34,233,236,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
