Fighting for the causes of unionization, unemployment and Social Security benefits, and the eight-hour day, they committed themselves to what they believed was the right way for America. Not just a rosy remembrance, Seeing Red  looks critically at the party's connection with the Soviet Union and its lack of internal democracy. An invaluable resource for courses in political science, political sociology, and social movements.\n\n================\n\nThanks go to &quot;badge&quot; for sharing the knowledge!\n\n================\n\nSource : VHS Rip\nGenre : History / Documentary\nDirectors : Jim Klein, Julia Reichert\n\nSize : 708,981,860 bytes\nRuntime : 1:41:00\n\nVideo Codec : XviD\nResolution : 660x480\nFramerate : 29.970\nVideo Bitrate : 796 kbs\n\nAudio Codec : MP3\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate : 128 kb/s [2 channels] CBR\n\n================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef5a8bbf6d03d6463c1ce8f3278f8afc27b7d81","amp;dn":"Seeing+Red%3A+Stories+of+American+Communists+%281983%29+-++%5BRequest%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef5a8bbf6d03d6463c1ce8f3278f8afc27b7d81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,245,168,187,246,208,61,100,99,193,206,143,50,120,248,175,194,123,125,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
