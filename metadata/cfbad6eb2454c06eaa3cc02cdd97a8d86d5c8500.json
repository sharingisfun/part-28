My parents have grown up in the 3rd \nReich and have talked about their experiences on some occasions. And now I hold a 35-years-old\n record in my hands, that deals with their and my history, and has been censored, indexed, hidden\n for 35 years and still is, and the musical could never be staged. It tells me that nothing has\n changed since 1933, also today our leaders are pied pipers who don't want us to use our own\n brains, if they are called Merkel, Obama, Putin or Bin Laden.\n This is not a glorification of the rise and fall of the Third Reich in Germany in the 30s and\n 40s, but it's not a product of the peace movement or any other moral institution either. This\n musical gives an overview of the historical events as good as possible in 80 Minutes, and \nwhatever your political stand is, the judgement is on you.\n The musicians were some geniuses way ahead of their time from the Hamburg Krautrock scene. \nThe music is based on Krautrock, but lends some ideas from Evita, Rocky Horror Picture Show and \nother productions of that period.\n If your downloading these recordings be aware that this time it's not the music industry \nwatching you, but your pied piper's secret service. And if you comment this post, you're welcome,\n but please keep in mind, that your comments tell as much about you as about the topic :-)\n\n\n There's an extensive review on RateYourMusic written by RDTEN1:\n This is easily one of the strangest albums in my collection and it's one I was hesitant to list\n for fear someone might mistake me as some sort of right wing nutcase. I'm not ... in fact as a\n member of the French resistance my mother was actually arrested by the Gestapo, dumped in a jail\n and only avoided being deported to a concentration camp when the US Army overran the prison she\n was being held in ... hum ... never thought that story would come up in a record review.\n So what do I know about 1977's &quot;Der FÃƒÂ¼hrer (Rock Opera)&quot;? German musicians Lothar Siems and\n Walter Quintus were apparently the brains behind the double album set. Siems and Quintus' musical\n partnership stretched back to the mid-1960s including stints in The Chamberlains, The Quintus\n Quartet, and a pair of early-1970s albums fronting the medieval/progressive influenced band\n Parzival. Parzival recorded a pair of albums before calling it quits in 1973. With that\n background it sure would be interesting to know how the pair (with an assist from Gisela\n Siems in the lyrics department), went from recording misdeal influenced tunes to this bizarre \nconcept piece. Self-produced, the album featured a strange Anglo-German cast including Ian \nCussick, Peter French, and Neil Landon. A 28 tracks, double album set, the plotline was pretty \nstraightforward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tracing the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler. Condensing twelve years (1933Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1945) \ninto about an hour was itself a pretty impressive feat, but if you believe the hype, the \nrecording sessions were surrounded by lots of weirdness including master tapes picking up \nstrange sounds. Anyhow, billed as a rock opera, the collection was clearly written with an ear \nto some sort of stage production. The songs themselves offered up a mixture of pop and rock \npieces (some of them quite good), but much of the set exhibited a distinctive theater feel. \nIn reviewing the album it was also hard to draw a clear distinction between the music and the \nstory plotline Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 'Magic Man' was a perfect case in point. Musically the song was amazingly catchy\n sounding like something 10CC might have written, but the lyric's about Hitler's early magnetism \non the German psychic made for a real mismatch. Great song, disturbing lyrics ... A good analogy \nwas The Police song 'Every Breath You Take'. The track was a major hit when I was in college and \nI had friends who simply adored the song, not realizing the lyrics detailed the thoughts of a \ncrazed stalker. Try to remember that when you're humming 'Magic Man' or 'What a Man!'. \n Please read the complete review, track by track, on RateYourMusic.  \n\n\nTracks\n 01. OuvertÃƒÂ¼re Ã‚Â· The pact 08:02\n 02.
