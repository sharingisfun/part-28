These were last words in public to sannyasins and to all.)\r\n\r\nThe last Osho talk in this vol 6 is last Osho's interview alltogether , given on 21 July 1989 am in LaoTzu House, Poona, India, \r\nAfter that there was just silence..no talk.\r\nThis last interview was \r\nInterview with Swami Satya Vedant asking questions from Pritish Nandy, Illustrated Weekly of India,\r\nOsho: So, I should address to Shree Pritish, that will be better.\r\nVEDANT: BELOVED OSHO,\r\nIN VIEW OF THE UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTIONS, THE EDITOR OF ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY,\r\nMR.

Therefore I placed this audio as no 4 in TLT vol 6.\r\n(text from Light on the Path no 34 is not equivalent to this talk..I don't know where it should be and where is audio which belongs to it.\r\nDifferent topics were spoken here as answers to the questions. \r\n\r\ntry to watch him on video as much you can.He said that in this way (video) he can transfer much more then in any other way (books, audios)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c720799eee395f4845abcda67578abb4816b8c4","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament+vol+6+of+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c720799eee395f4845abcda67578abb4816b8c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,114,7,153,238,227,149,244,132,90,188,218,103,87,138,187,72,22,184,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
