Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.\r\n\r\nThe game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.\r\n\r\nMedieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldnâ€™t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.\r\n\r\nMedieval Engineers is the second â€œengineeringâ€ game developed by Keen Software House. The first one is Space Engineers, which sold over 1 million copies in its first year and is still a bestseller.\r\nEarly Access\r\n\r\n    Game modes\r\n    - Creative - unlimited resources, instant building, invulnerability, levitation\r\n    - Survival - this mode is work-in-progress. Currently available: death/respawn, survival building, resource management, inventory, character stats (health, stamina, food)\r\n    Single-player\r\n    Multiplayer - alpha version (not final)\r\n    - Creative and survival mode with your friends\r\n    - Cooperative: build together with your friends, protect your castles/cities from barbarian raids\r\n    - Competitive: battle against other players\r\n    - Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public\r\n    - Max 16 players (this may increase in the future)\r\n    Castle siege mode - play as an attacker or defender and either defend your castle from opponentsâ€™ raid or lead the attack to take charge and capture the castle\r\n    Character crafting - craft your tools using the basic resources such as scrap wood or small stones\r\n    Dedicated servers - players can connect to a third party host, rather than using a player-host, in a peer-to-peer set-up. The result is a faster connection and a more fluid multiplayer performance with less lag\r\n    Barbarians - first prototype of enemy AI\r\n    Barbarian waves (survival mode) - barbarians will attack players in waves during the night\r\n    Peasants - first prototype of friendly AI. Able to pick up stones and move them to his spawn position.\r\n    Weapons - Crossbow, sword\r\n    First-person &amp; Third-person\r\n    Voxel hand â€“ shape the terrain and its material (right now only creative mode voxel hand is implemented)\r\n    Block types:\r\n    - Small: 0.25 meter (25 centimeters)\r\n    - Large: 2.5 meters\r\n    - Dynamic: can be used to construct carriages and machinery that is supposed to be moved around\r\n    - Static: immovable and connected to earth; if a heavy load breaks its structural integrity it cracks and unsupported parts become dynamic\r\n    Building blocks: stone walls (various shapes - from blocky to rounded), wooden walls and flooring, roofs (ceramic, thatched, hay), power source blocks (manual human labor), stored energy blocks (torsion spring), leverages, weights, swings, ropes, wooden beams of various length and shapeâ€¦ More will be added in future!\r\n    Realistic physics â€“ structural integrity, destructible objects (everything: from blocks to terrain), real proportions, volume, mass, storage capacity, integrity\r\n    Steam Workshop â€“ share your creations with the Community\r\n    Modding - world files, 3D models, textures, shaders, API (scripting in-game objects in C#)\r\n    32-bit &amp; 64-bit â€“ 64-bit version expands the amount of objects and blocks (almost unlimited) and terrain\r\n    World management â€“ generate new worlds, â€œsave asâ€ to multiple copies, auto-save every 5 minutes (can be turned on/off), edit world settings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f6db11057865f8d462d2f60fc8768552b34690a","amp;dn":"Medieval+Engineers+v02.043.008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f6db11057865f8d462d2f60fc8768552b34690a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,109,177,16,87,134,95,141,70,45,47,96,252,135,104,85,43,52,105,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
