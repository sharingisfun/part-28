Saren, a rogue member of the elite and untouchable Spectre agents, has discovered the secret to unleashing an apocalyptic force on the galaxy, and only you stand in his way.

The Galaxy map doesn't work and saves stop working after a while. There are some fixes floating around the net, but some say they cause other problems. If you want to be on the safe side, you will have to wait for a proper crack, but with this you'll at least have the game. \n\nI long for the days when a release carrying the name Reloaded meant that it would work perfectly no matter what... \n\n[Installation] \n\n1. Unrar. \n2. Burn or mount the image. \n3. Install the game, use the keygen located in the Crack dir on the DVD to generate a serial. \n4. Copy the cracked content over from the Crack directory on the DVD to your installationBinaries directory. \n5. Play the game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ddb3a2b8efdb27d85b9a26b43177aab07bdb4a1","amp;dn":"Mass.Effect.PROPER-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ddb3a2b8efdb27d85b9a26b43177aab07bdb4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,219,58,43,142,253,178,125,133,185,162,107,67,23,122,171,7,189,180,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
