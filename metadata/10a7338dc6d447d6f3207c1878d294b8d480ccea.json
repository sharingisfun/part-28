Since that event, Ichigo has to fight hollows, evil spirits that attack people.In the process he makes new Friends with special abilities. After various events, Rukia is sentenced to death by her Soul Reapers' superiors for her actions, leading Ichigo to encounter them to save her life. He also encounters former Soul Reaper SÃ…ï¿½suke Aizen, who created an army of powerful hollow called arrancar to destroy the Soul Reapers organization, Soul Society.\nIchigo Kurosaki has always been able to see ghosts, but this ability doesn't change his life nearly as much as his close encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper and member of the mysterious Soul Society. While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia--who is slowly regaining her powers--it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace\n\n\n\n&quot;This verified torrent was uploaded to Torlock.com.&quot;\n\n\n\nAlternative title  : Ãâ€˜ÃÂ»ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€¡ (Russian)\n                     Ã£Æ’â€“Ã£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’ï¿½ (Japanese)\n                     Ã¦Â­Â»Ã§Â¥Å¾ (Chinese (Taiwan))\n                     Ã«Â¸â€Ã«Â¦Â¬Ã¬Â¹Ëœ (Korean)\n\n\nYears of Released  : 2001 -  Ongoing \n\n\nStatus             : Ongoing, bleach 488 is coming next...
