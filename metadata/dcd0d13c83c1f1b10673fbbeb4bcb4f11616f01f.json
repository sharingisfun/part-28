Rival Swords retains the essence of what made Two Thrones such a great game in 2005. But rereleasing a game at full price a year and a half after the original doesn't come without expectations, and the added motion-sensing controls do little to justify the lack of a graphical update or the omission of meaningful extras.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd0d13c83c1f1b10673fbbeb4bcb4f11616f01f","amp;dn":"Prince+of+Persia%3A+Rival+Swords+%28Wii%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd0d13c83c1f1b10673fbbeb4bcb4f11616f01f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,208,209,60,131,193,241,177,6,115,251,190,180,188,180,241,22,22,240,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
