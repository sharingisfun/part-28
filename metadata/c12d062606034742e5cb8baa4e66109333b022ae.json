It is their\nninth studio album. All of the tracks (except &quot;Way Out Of\nHere&quot;) were debuted live during Porcupine Tree&amp;#039;s\npromotional tour for the Arriving Somewhere DVD from\nSeptember to November 2006. The album will be released on\nthe 16th April 2007 in the UK and Europe, and the 24th\nApril in the USA. The album tracks flow into each other,\nforming one 50-minute piece. On the 12th January 2007 page\nof his journal, Robert Fripp mentions that one of the\nsongs recorded is called &quot;Nil Recurring&quot;, which is not\nincluded on the album but will likely be released as a\nbonus track in a special edition, as Porcupine Tree\nouttakes generally are.\n\nOn February 21st, a preview was posted on the band&amp;#039;s\nMySpace page, which contains samples of each track. The\ntitle track of the album was released on March 6th in the\nUS iTunes Store as a bonus track with the album Blackfield\nII.\n\nAlso, a dedicated mini-site is being developed. Currently,\nit contains a stream of the album preview and various\ndownloads including wallpapers, banners and icons.\n\nSince 31st March, all the tracks have been available on\nthe internet but only as radio rips.\n\nThough receiving no public mention, the album&amp;#039;s title\nbears a striking similarity to the Public Enemy album,\nFear of a Black Planet and the Third Eye Foundation single\nFear of a Whack Planet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c12d062606034742e5cb8baa4e66109333b022ae","amp;dn":"Porcupine_Tree-Fear_Of_A_Blank_Planet-2007-SAW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c12d062606034742e5cb8baa4e66109333b022ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,45,6,38,6,3,71,66,229,203,139,170,78,102,16,147,51,176,34,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
