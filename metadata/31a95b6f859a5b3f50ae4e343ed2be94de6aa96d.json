Ronnie says &quot;Hello Fresno. It's been a couple years since I've been back here.&quot; &gt; Shame on the Night\n\nAfter &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;. Ronnie &quot;Last night we were in Bakersfield. And in Bakersfield I said something about Fresno...&quot; &gt; Holy Diver\n\nRonnie also mentions Fresno during the Heaven &amp; Hell &quot;On &amp; On&quot; part with the audience &amp; that some of Black Sabbath's Live Evil was recorded here.\n\n\nAfter MOTSM. Fades out as Ronnie is saying &quot;We love playing for you...&quot;\n\nTo me it seems there may have been some editing or commercial breaks previously between some of these tracks.\n==============================================================\n\n\nSome sources suggest the date for Fresno, CA was October 16th or 17th, but both of those dates are incorrect. \nHoly Diver tour stopped just once in Fresno, CA and it was on December 28th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a95b6f859a5b3f50ae4e343ed2be94de6aa96d","amp;dn":"DIO+1983-12-28+Selland+Arena%2C+Fresno%2C+California+FLAC+SDB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a95b6f859a5b3f50ae4e343ed2be94de6aa96d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,169,91,111,133,154,91,63,80,174,78,52,62,210,190,148,222,106,169,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
