(.wmv) NO DRM\nSize: ~390MB\nLanguage: English, no subs\n\nThis is most likely the worst movie in the series, but worth seeing for free.\nThis is a DVD rip. It's watchable, but the video quality sucks a bit, especially on a big TV.  I ripped it this way so that it is quick to download, and save your HDD space.  The audio has no problems.  If you can't seek while watching, there is nothing wrong with my file.  You need to update to WMV9 codec which is free and provided by Microsoft. This is NOTHING like divoCodec (BAD)\n\nI know that the following players support this file: WMP, MPC ,and VLC \nI haven't tried it in Real or Winamp but it should work.\n\nPlease seed more than you download, so the torrent gets stronger:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6018f64fe4110b1dc972bb7f895916f30ff32664","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+6+-+Half+Blood+Prince+-+-+-++english.DVDrip.small+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6018f64fe4110b1dc972bb7f895916f30ff32664","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,24,246,79,228,17,11,29,201,114,187,127,137,89,22,243,15,243,38,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
