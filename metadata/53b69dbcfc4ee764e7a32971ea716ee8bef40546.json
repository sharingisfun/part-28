WIG rides above the surface like an airplane on a dynamic air cushion that is produced by the vesselÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forward motion. The adoption of WIG has been slow due to the complicated technology issues surrounding the vessel; it is a hybrid vehicle that combines marine and aviation theory, wing theory and air cushion theory, aerodynamic and hydrodynamic theory. &quot;WIG Craft and Ekranoplan: Ground Effect Craft Technology&quot; provides a comprehensive overview of the design, development and building of WIG vessels. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous  examples and  illustrative applications, Liang Yun, Alan Bliault and Johnny Doo discuss: Basic principles of WIG craft technology State of the art overview of WIG craft technology in the United States, Russia, Germany, China and Australia Material and structural design of WIG craft Lift and propulsion systems of WIG craft WIG Craft and Ekranoplan: Ground Effect Craft Technology  will be of interest to naval engineers, aviation engineers, naval architects, and mechanical engineers interested in the development and research of wing in ground (WIG) and high performance marine vehicles.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/WIG-Craft-Ekranoplan-Ground-Technology/dp/1441900411&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/WIG-Craft-Ekranoplan-Ground-Technology/dp/1441900411&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b69dbcfc4ee764e7a32971ea716ee8bef40546","amp;dn":"WIG+Craft+and+Ekranoplan%3A+Ground+Effect+Craft+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b69dbcfc4ee764e7a32971ea716ee8bef40546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,182,157,188,252,78,231,100,231,163,41,113,234,113,110,232,190,244,5,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
