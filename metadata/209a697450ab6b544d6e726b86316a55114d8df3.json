Not produced in a studio or staged in a concert hall, it was recorded live in the church of St Nicholas on the Three Mountains in Moscow, with the composer as the celebrant and the voices of the State Tretyakov Gallery Choir leading the faithful in prayer. Marked by a peaceful, bright mood, the melodies are simple, easily remembered, and similar to the Obikhod (book of daily services). Inspired by his service at the altar of God, Archbishop Hilarion composed a Divine Liturgy that draws both the celebrant and the worshipers into a prayerful atmosphere. The insert accompanying the CD includes information about the liturgy, composer, director, and choir. 26 Tracks Total time 70:5.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:209a697450ab6b544d6e726b86316a55114d8df3","amp;dn":"Hilarion+Alfeyev+The+Divine+Liturgy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"209a697450ab6b544d6e726b86316a55114d8df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,154,105,116,80,171,107,84,77,110,114,107,134,49,106,85,17,77,141,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
