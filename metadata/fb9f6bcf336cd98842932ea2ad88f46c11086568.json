The hard rocking five-piece band poured body and soul into fomenting a social-psychoactive revolution that they hoped would reshape the buttoned down, conventional landscape of contemporary American culture. The MC5 was founded on the notion that rules are to be broken and they became the very embodiment of no-holds-barred rock and roll.\nThough never as widely popular as The Who, The Kinks, Dylan and other ?60s icons, The MC5?s influence amongst musicians is pervasive. They pioneered approaches to wall-of-sound ?sculpted noise?, free form art rock, improvisational guitar freak-outs and even glam rock that are emulated by modern bands to this day. If anything, The MC5?s legend grows with each passing year.\nOne key figure in The MC5?s rise to fame was photographer Leni Sinclair whose images of the band have become emblematic of the 60 and 70s themselves. She and her husband John Sinclair ? the radical left-wing activist and psychedelic guru who some believe used the band to inflate his own fame and power ? were daily companions of The MC5 throughout the highpoint of their careers. One result of that deep access is a collection of 8mm films of the band that Leni shot at various shows in the late ?60s and early ?70s. MC5 Live: Kick Out the Jams is a collection of these clips, many of them available for the first time on home video.\n\nDuracao ...............................: 33:48\nPais...................................: Estados Unidos da America\nVideo Codec ...........................: XviD\nFrame Size ............................: 720 x 480\nVideo Bitrate .........................: 2.453\nAudio Codec ...........................: MPEG1/2 L3\nSample Rate ...........................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate .........................: 256 kbps  44 KHz\nTamanho do arquivo.....................: 658.3 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb9f6bcf336cd98842932ea2ad88f46c11086568","amp;dn":"MC5++Kick+ou+the+Jams+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb9f6bcf336cd98842932ea2ad88f46c11086568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,159,107,207,51,108,217,136,66,147,46,162,173,136,244,108,17,8,101,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
