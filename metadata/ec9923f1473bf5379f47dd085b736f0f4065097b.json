Delve into a dreamlike and surreal 1920s world, inspired by the \n\nperformance art world of vaudeville and film noir, and cradled by a smooth and sultry jazz ambiance. \n\nIn this universe, where the boundaries between showmanship, magic, intrigue and deception are blurred, you play \n\nDawn, the imaginary friend of a young girl named Didi. You have the power to slip from the 3D dreamscape into the \n\nparallel 2D shadow world bound to it. Cast light on a shadowy story by manipulating light sources in the 3D world \n\nto distort, enlarge or stretch the 2D shadow world. Manipulating and shifting between light and shadow will be \n\nthe key elements that you will need to use to solve our world of shadow-based puzzles and help progress Didi's \n\nstory! \n\nKey Features \nShift between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world, at any lit wall surface \nCreate unique shadow landscapes by manipulating light sources and real world objects, and use this ability to \n\nsolve mind-bending puzzles \nExperience a new story and world, exploring adult themes through a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes \nImmerse yourself in a lush vaudevillian world of cabaret singers, circus performers, and magic\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1.
