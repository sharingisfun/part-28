Once actual zombies begin popping up in our world, a lone intelligence analyst\n\nrealizes real-life events are beginning to mimic the events of a long-lost, Grade-Z, drive-in horror flick. As he races to save humanity with this knowledge, he quickly learns the only thing more dangerous than ravenous walking corpses is the ineptitude of the living! The gutsplitting (and then eating) comedy that pokes fun at the zombie horror phenomenon! Illustrated in graytones with red highlights (for blood and gore, of course), so it feels like the ever-popular The Walking Dead series. Collects the complete storyline from issues #1-5 of The Mocking Dead comic book series complete with a cover gallery!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932067a57919d7667d6d806d4dc2c3fb2ef653f1","amp;dn":"The_Mocking_Dead_TPB_%282014-02%29_%28Digital%29_%28Monafekk-Empire%29.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932067a57919d7667d6d806d4dc2c3fb2ef653f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,32,103,165,121,25,215,102,125,109,128,109,77,194,195,251,46,246,83,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
