Through stunning CGI, witness the birth pangs of the solar system, shocked into existence by a nearby supernova, and enduring over 700 million years of brutal bombardment by deadly asteroids; colossal cataclysms that shaped the planets and transformed their climates forever; and startling new scientific discoveries revealing a hellish history of continuous devastation on Earth. And travel to the system's very fringes to explore the possibility that the Sun has an evil twin, a monstrous star known as Nemesis suspected of causing every mass extinction in Earth's history. In signature cutting-edge style, THE UNIVERSE features astounding NASA footage and the opinions of leading astrophysicists to probe even more deeply into the billion-years-old story of the world beyond Earth.\n\n\n\n\n13)  Ride the Comet \n&quot;Chart a daring course with comets, the cosmic time travellers of the skies.&quot;\nThe episode gives us a pretty good primer on what comets are and how they behave. Much of the episode has us following a fictional future spacecraft that follows the long journey of a comet as it goes around the sun. Of course, these guys won't resist showing us some of the devastation that comet collisions with Earth might bring, or have brought.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2170 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.793 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 23\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 14\n * Part Size: average 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e008297b48001fbd3a328bfda9b0cb61640c04fc","amp;dn":"History+Ch+The+Universe+Season+6+13of14+Ride+the+Comet+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e008297b48001fbd3a328bfda9b0cb61640c04fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,8,41,123,72,0,31,189,58,50,139,253,169,176,203,97,100,12,4,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
