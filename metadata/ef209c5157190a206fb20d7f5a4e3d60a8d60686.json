Instead, it took them all over the place, continuing to burst the envelope of pop music. Lennon and McCartney were still at the height of their powers, with Lennon in particular growing into one of rock's towering figures. But even McCartney could still rock, and the amazement on &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was that he had vocal cords at the end. From Beach Boys knock-offs to reggae and to the unknown (&quot;Revolution #9&quot;), this has\nit all. Some records have legend written all over them; this is one. --Chris Nickson\n\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Back in the U.S.S.R.
