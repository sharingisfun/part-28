The Partisan Seed, Filipe Miranda's most personal\nproject, is an artistic compromise to sincerity and, above\nall, with great quality. An acoustic base that sometimes\ntakes us to the most melancholic folk, but on contours and\nsilhouettes with exotic fragrances, influenced by the\nMediterranean feeling.\n\nLyrically rich, Filipe Miranda is inspired by literature,\ndreams, religion and the reality surrounding him. It's a\nrecord made of simple songs, and using Filipe's own words,\n'songs with subtle messages, like the words of a muezzin\npraying very softly'. An enchanted smoothness that requires\nsilence and care. The gods don't sing much ('if you know\nthe gods who made all the laws / ask them to sing a little\nbit more', in Sound, We Make Sound). But we'll always have\nthe angels.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepartisanseed.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepartisanseed.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSecond free album from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from\nthe artist's Bandcamp store, including front cover, ID3\ntags and file names cleaned up, and everything packed comme\nil faut. No reencoding, of course.\n__________________________________________________\n\nncore releases\n38+: http://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo\n1-37: http://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a29a5d7f902487e6430396e6e1e72a26b61035","amp;dn":"The_Partisan_Seed-Indian_Summer-Web-2008-ncore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a29a5d7f902487e6430396e6e1e72a26b61035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,162,154,93,127,144,36,135,230,67,3,150,230,225,231,42,38,182,16,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
