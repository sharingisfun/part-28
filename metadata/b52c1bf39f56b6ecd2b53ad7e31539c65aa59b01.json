The heart of this areaÃ¢â‚¬â€the Acadiana region of LouisianaÃ¢â‚¬â€is a tough land that funnels its spirit into the local cuisine. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find more delicious, rustic, and satisfying country cooking than the dirty rice, spicy sausage, and fresh crawfish that this area is known for. It takes a homegrown guide to show us around the back roads of this particularly unique region, and in Real Cajun, James Beard AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning chef Donald Link shares his own rough-and-tumble stories of living, cooking, and eating in Cajun Country.\n\nLink takes us on an expedition to the swamps and smokehouses and the music festivals, funerals, and holiday celebrations, but, more important, reveals the fish fries, etouffees, and pots of GrannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seafood gumbo that always accompany them. The food now famous at LinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased restaurants, Cochon and Herbsaint, has roots in the family dishes and traditions that he shares in this book. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find recipes for Seafood Gumbo, Smothered Pork Roast over Rice, Baked Oysters with Herbsaint Hollandaise, Louisiana Crawfish Boudin, quick and easy Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits with Fig-Ginger Preserves, Bourbon-Soaked Bread Pudding with White and Dark Chocolate, and Blueberry Ice Cream made with fresh summer berries. Link throws in a few lagniappes to give you an idea of life in the bayou, such as strategies for a great trip to Jazz Fest, a what-not-to-do instructional on catching turtles, and all you ever (or never) wanted to know about boudin sausage. Colorful personal essays enrich every recipe and introduce his grandfather and friends as they fish, shrimp, hunt, and dance.\n\nFrom the backyards where crawfish boils reign as the greatest of outdoor events to the white tablecloths of LinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famed restaurants, Real Cajun takes you on a rollicking and inspiring tour of this wild part of America and shares the soulful recipes that capture its irrepressible spirit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52c1bf39f56b6ecd2b53ad7e31539c65aa59b01","amp;dn":"Real+Cajun%3A+Rustic+Home+Cooking+from+Donald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52c1bf39f56b6ecd2b53ad7e31539c65aa59b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,44,27,243,159,86,182,236,210,181,58,215,227,21,57,198,90,165,155,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
