With his sophomore album on the horizon, Sean describes himself as being hungry again, which you can hear all throughout Detroit, which features a wide range of different sounding songs with an extremely well thought out structure behind the project. In addition to that, the mixtape features production and features from French Montana, J. Cole, Key Wayne, Young Chop, Lex Luger, Chris Brown, Kendrick Lamar, King Chip, Don Cannon, Juicy J and more.
