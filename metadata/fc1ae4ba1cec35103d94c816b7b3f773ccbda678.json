With careful research and meticulous re-creations, this expedition comes to life for the first time in stunning high-definition. Two hundred years after their epic journey, go back in time with Lewis, Clark, their guide Sacagawea, and the brave Corps of Discovery as they discover the adventure, danger, and beauty of the unmapped West America had not thoroughly explored the Louisiana Purchase obtained from Napoleon's France until Thomas Jefferson sent his secretary on an expedition through the territory. Merriweather Lewis enlisted his friend William Clark to lead the journey with him and in 1804 they set out to explore this massive tract of land. Eventually the pair was joined by Toussaint Charbonneau and his Indian wife, Sacagawea, who proved to be a valuable interpreter of the native languages. Lewis and Clark were presumed dead until their return to St. Louis in 1806. This National Geographic presentation examines this important adventure in American history.
