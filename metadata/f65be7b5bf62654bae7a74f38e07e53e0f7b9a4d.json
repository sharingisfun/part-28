Added to this, Britain's cities were in the grip of the worst German attacks since the Blitz of 1940. Unmanned flying bombs - the dreaded V1 'Doodlebugs' and V2 rockets - rained down, stretching morale and services to breaking point. Having been set the target of doubling home-grown food production by the government, Britain's farmers had already ploughed up six and a half million additional acres in the drive for additional crops (an area equivalent in size to the whole of Wales). Now, in addition to maintaining food production, it fell to Britain's farmers to come to the aid of the nation's urban dispossessed in their hour of need. Many rural women joined the one million-strong Women's Voluntary Service to provide food, drink and gifts to lift the spirits - especially at Christmas. Ruth finds out how the WVS operated the government's National Pie Scheme. Beer was seen as so essential to the nation's morale that it was never rationed - but a vital ingredient, barley, was in short supply, so substitutes were needed. Peter calls upon rural crafts expert, Colin Richards, to brew some improvised potato beer for Christmas. Meanwhile, Ruth comes up with innovative presents for children, and ingenious festive decorations made from scraps. Following recipes and guidelines issued by the government and the WVS, Ruth cooks an improvised Christmas meal, relying chiefly on rabbit and a glut of carrots from the farm. And the Salvation Army bring musical cheer to the occasion as the team reflect on the impact of what was to be the last Christmas of the Second World War.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7772/wartimefarmchristmasscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1526 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 700 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-wartime-farm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-wartime-farm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wartime%20Farm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wartime%20Farm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Edwardian%20Farm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Edwardian%20Farm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Victorian%20Farm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Victorian%20Farm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f65be7b5bf62654bae7a74f38e07e53e0f7b9a4d","amp;dn":"BBC+Wartime+Farm+Christmas+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f65be7b5bf62654bae7a74f38e07e53e0f7b9a4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,91,231,181,191,98,101,75,174,122,116,243,142,7,229,62,15,123,154,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
