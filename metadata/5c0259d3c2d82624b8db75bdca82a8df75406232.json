Plus every issue comes with a double sided DVD packed full of HD content. \n\nSister title to the Official Xbox 360 magazine. We do things differently. We finish games \n\nbefore we review them. We never forget how much games cost. We don t approach \n\nsections like news, and communities like Xbox Live, in the same way as everyone else. \n\nOh, and we make better jokes than the competition. Some might even make you laugh. \n\n\nYear - 2012 \nIssue - February \nFormat - .pdf \nCountry - UK \nPages - 132 \nSize - 38.9 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c0259d3c2d82624b8db75bdca82a8df75406232","amp;dn":"XBOX+World+Magazine+%28UK%29+-+February+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c0259d3c2d82624b8db75bdca82a8df75406232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,2,89,211,194,216,38,36,184,219,117,189,202,130,168,223,117,64,98,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
