Still recommend a purchase though. :)\n\nTo be up-front, this is mostly a fan translation uploaded and compiled from before the manga was licensed or fully released in North America, so bear with some chapters as they're a tad rough. Also included to HOPEFULLY make up for it are some pretty cool pieces of art and colorized pages.\n\nSYNOPSIS: In the not too distant future, mankind fights over relics from an ancient civilization called O-Parts, each of which contain incredible powers. Some people with special abilities are able to use the O-Parts to their full potential, and are known as O.P.T.s (or O-Parts Tacticians). Naturally, O-Parts can be used for both good and evil purposes.\n\nJio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money. Little does he suspect that he is actually a very powerful O.P.T.s, and inside him sleeps a demon of incredible ferocity. He meets up with a girl named Ruby who, like her famous father before her, wants to become a treasure hunter. Though Jio doesn't believe in friendship, he agrees to be Ruby's bodyguard, and together they go on a dangerous quest to discover as many O-Parts as they can. \n\nCredit goes mostly to the folks here: http://bakabt.me/140375-666-satan-o-parts-hunter.html for compiling the chapters in image form. I just re-packed them into .cbr format and added the missing Gaiden chapter as well as added some more art/pages I had handy.\n\nHere's hoping you enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c07dfe35f82a0e3143184f3745a9cc7088b8d5","amp;dn":"O-Parts+Hunter+%28666+Satan%29+Complete+Manga+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c07dfe35f82a0e3143184f3745a9cc7088b8d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,192,125,254,53,248,42,14,49,67,24,79,55,69,169,204,112,136,184,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
