It is becoming apparent that Angela's murder was not simply a random attack. Convinced that there is more to the case than meets the eye, Alec and Nina visit her father, who tells them that he gave some documents that Angela had typed to a mysterious figure, known as the Ghost Detective. Back at the station, the detectives receive another DVD parcel showing someone breaking into Angela's house. Unsure of whom to trust, Alec and Nina have to decide whether to tell Michael or keep it a secret","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586785a1ab798c60d53babb20e0bcc94674e0ebc","amp;dn":"Paranoid+S01E02+HDTV+x264-ORGANiC%5Bstate%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586785a1ab798c60d53babb20e0bcc94674e0ebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,103,133,161,171,121,140,96,213,59,171,178,14,11,204,148,103,78,14,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
