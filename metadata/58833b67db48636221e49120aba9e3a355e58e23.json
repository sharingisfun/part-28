(Now they display icons for the default keyboard and mouse bindings instead.)\n-Mouse is not &quot;grabbed&quot; by the window and will stop you from turning when it hits the edges of the screen.\n-Autotargeting goes totally crazy\n\n\n\n========= INSTALLATION: =========\n\nSimply copy the files to your DarkSouls directory.\n\n\nIt works out of the box, but here are some recommendations:\n1. By default, I have disabled the 60 FPS limit. You will need to enable it in the DSfix ini if you want a fps over 30.\n\n2. Make sure to disable AA ingame--and use DSfix settings instead.\n\n3. Set your &quot;Camera&quot; setting ingame to 10.\n\n=================================\n\n\nCREDIT:\nThis package includes three mods, listed here. I have also provided links to where you can find the original mods yourself.\n\n1. Durante's excellent &quot;DSFix&quot; mod. Enables +60 fps and basic image-quality improving stuff.
