Their popular records include Wishbone Ash (1970), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976). They were one of the first of many bands to come who used twin lead guitars.\n\nWishbone Ash are considered to be one of the major innovators of the harmony twin lead guitar format. Their contributions helped in Powell and Turner being voted &quot;Two Of The Ten Most Important Guitarists In Rock History&quot; (Traffic magazine 1989), and part of the &quot;Top 20 Guitarists Of All Time&quot; (Rolling Stone magazine). Melody Maker (1972) described Ted Turner and Andy Powell as &quot;the most interesting two guitar team since the days when Beck and Page graced The Yardbirds&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b51fe2f0db9af9ff050af891245f1be3f52575","amp;dn":"Wishbone+Ash+-+Their+Greatest+Hits+%28Live%29+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b51fe2f0db9af9ff050af891245f1be3f52575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,181,31,226,240,219,154,249,255,5,10,248,145,36,95,27,227,245,37,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
