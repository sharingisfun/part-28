Band members at this time \nwere Lars on drums, Ron McGovni on bass, Dave Mustaine on guitar and \nJames on vocals \n1. Original version of &quot;The Four Hoursemen&quot;\n2. This song was originally recorded by &quot;Sweet Savage&quot;. Metallica released a \n   later version in 1991 as B-side of &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.\n3. One of the rarest Metallica songs in existence. It has never been \n   performed live or recorded as a Demo. This song was originally done by \n   &quot;Savage&quot; on the album &quot;Loose 'N' Lethal&quot;. This track has never released on \n   any Metallica CD, LP or single.\n4. This song was originally done by &quot;Diamond Head&quot; on the album &quot;Lightning \n   To The Nations&quot;.\n5. This song was originally recorded by &quot;Diamond Head&quot;. Metallica released a \n   later version in 1988 as B-side of &quot;One&quot;.\n6. This previously unreleased Dave Mustaine original is somewhat different \n   than the 1983 &quot;Kill Em All&quot; version.\n7. March '83. Demo version with Dave Mustaine, Cliff Burton, James and \n   Lars. Recorded from KUSF Radio in San Francisco. This track has never \n   appeared on LP or CD at the correct speed. One of only two studio tracks to \n   future Dave and Cliff together.\n8. March '83. Taken from the same demo. This too has never appeared on LP \n   or CD at the correct speed.\n9. Alternate demo version recorded in 1988.\n10. Recorded live at the &quot;Monsters Of Rock&quot; festival, Castle Donnington \n    28.08.1995.

Also recorded live at the &quot;Monsters Of Rock '95&quot; festival.\n12. Recorded live at the Wembley Arena in London 25.10.93, which was the \n    first time Metallica played &quot;So What&quot; live. What obviously made this so cool \n    was that Animal (the singer from the &quot;Anti-Nowhere League&quot;, which was the \n    band that originally composed this song) got dragged up to sing the song.\n13th and 14th song were recorded live at the N.E.C. in Birmingham \n    5.01.1993 by Metallica and the four original members of &quot;Diamond Head&quot; (the \n    band that originally composed these two master-pieces of music).\n15.
