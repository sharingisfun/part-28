Gumbo John , I Want My Fleetwood Back and The Delta Singer are classic Tony Joe. If Tony Joe was anymore lay back on the title track One Hot July he would be asleep. To anyone who is a fan of Tony Joe White this is a must.&quot;\n\n&quot;it&amp;#039;s really sad so little is known about this unique, one of a kind, truly natural talent. bring him back!&quot;\n\n&quot;I had the pleasure of seeing Tony Joe White when he performed in Perth, Australia, April 1999. He just gets better and better. This album is a treat. &quot;Crack The Window Baby&quot; is a song anyone can identify with who lives in a hot climate or a hot bedroom. My favorite is &quot;Cold Fingers&quot; and the song which could become one&amp;#039;s motto: &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Over Do It&quot;. Tony is a rare talent, if you can&amp;#039;t see him live, this album is close to the truth and can really take you down rockin!&quot;\n\n&quot;The 58 year old comback kid Tony Joe White has done it again. The Louisiana swamps ooze out of every note. Recorded last year in Louisiana TJW has assembled a great back up group with help from daughter Michelle on Old Black Crow real southern funk. Great keyboards throughout adds to the atmosphere. Across from Midnight is quite different to the Cocker version. Also worth a mention is I want my fleetwood back, Gumbo John with his pet alligator Clyde. We all look forward to see him tour Australia again next month it is a special experience. There is a song The Delta Singer with lyrics about blues notes on the Australian wind. great stuff!&quot; \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
