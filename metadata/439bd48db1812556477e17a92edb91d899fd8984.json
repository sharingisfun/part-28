Australia&amp;#039;s Darchinyan was immediately dropped with the punch, and though he barely made it to his feet before the referee&amp;#039;s &quot;ten count&quot; he stumbled into the ropes where his corner rescued him and the ref wisely waved the contest off.\n\nDonaire improved to 18-1 (11). Darchinyan dropped to 28-1 (22).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439bd48db1812556477e17a92edb91d899fd8984","amp;dn":"Vic+Darchinyan+vs.+Nonito+Donaire.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439bd48db1812556477e17a92edb91d899fd8984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,155,212,141,177,129,37,86,71,126,23,169,46,219,145,216,153,253,137,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
