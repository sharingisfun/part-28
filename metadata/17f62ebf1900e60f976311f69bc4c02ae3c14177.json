There is the geographic kind, of course, but also the journey through the seasons of nature, and, especially, the trip a love affair represents from its beginning to end. Edwards seems to be in transit right from the start, at least in terms of intentions, with the folk-pop leadoff track proclaiming, &quot;I'm movin' to America,&quot; before the singer quickly adds, &quot;It's an empty threat.&quot; Still, that's a good representation of the themes of the record, as Edwards explores troubled feelings, often expressing dissatisfaction with a lover she is simultaneously obsessed with and unhappy about. &quot;I don't want to feel this way,&quot; she says on the slow, ethereal &quot;Pink Champagne,&quot; but by the next song she is declaring, &quot;Anywhere you go, I'll follow,&quot; even though the song is called &quot;Going to Hell.&quot; The folk and rock arrangements, sometimes ambient, sometimes reminiscent of Sheryl Crow (especially the deliberately paced electric guitar rocker &quot;Mint&quot;), support Edwards' listless, melancholy soprano singing, which in turn reflects her unhappiness and pessimism. It all culminates in the seven-minute &quot;For the Record,&quot; on which she simultaneously compares her suffering with the passion of Christ and dismisses it as simply her chosen profession. &quot;Hang me up on your cross,&quot; she sings, &quot;For the record, I only wanted to sing songs.&quot; She manages to sing through her torment on Voyageur, in hope that the journey is ultimately redemptive. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/12/09/kathleen-edwards/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f62ebf1900e60f976311f69bc4c02ae3c14177","amp;dn":"Kathleen+Edwards...Voyageur%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f62ebf1900e60f976311f69bc4c02ae3c14177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,246,46,191,25,0,230,15,151,99,17,246,155,196,192,42,227,193,65,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
