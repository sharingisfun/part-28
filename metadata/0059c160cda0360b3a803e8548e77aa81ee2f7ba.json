The father is carrying a walkie talkie and his teenage son stares at them with hatred. As the SEALS agonize over whether the family is linked to the Taliban and they try to decide what to do with them, it sets of a string of events. \n\nA communications glitch has cut them off from Headquarters. When a fight breaks out, all of the SEALs, except for Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), are killed. Luttrell has to find a way to survive. \n\nBased on the New York Times bestseller by Marcus Luttrell.\n\n\n----------MEDiA iNFO------------\n\nSOURCE TYPE.....: BLURAY  \nRUNTIME.........: 02:01:14(h:m:s)\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 13.8 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 24 fps\nAUDIO...........: English DTS 5.1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1920 x 804\nSUBTiTLE........: English\nENCODER ........: Philla\n\n----------X264 iNFO------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0059c160cda0360b3a803e8548e77aa81ee2f7ba","amp;dn":"Lone+Survivor+2013+1080p+BluRay+x264+DTS+5.1+Philla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0059c160cda0360b3a803e8548e77aa81ee2f7ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,89,193,96,205,160,54,11,58,128,62,133,72,231,122,168,30,226,247,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
