How Embarrassing features an appearance by Lady Gaga. The album inspired a documentary and original soundtrack released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInitially planned as a short film by Los Angeles based BZR Entertainment, the project was later put on hold after the performer lost control at the taping.The meltdown at the DVD taping, provided inspiration for the album which Duran began in January 2009. Duran was able to get an exclusive interview with Lady Gaga which he made the initial selling point of the release. How Embarrassing eventually evolved into an in depth showcase of Duran as a radio personality and stand up comedian.\n\nDuran recorded over 300 songs with differen't producers including Tim Nubomb. Many were scrapped due to uncleared samples. Prior to 'How Embarrassing' Duran had only included X Rated song parodies on his releases. By completion he had taught himself to rap and written songs for Britney Spears and Selena Gomez.\n\nNubomb's Going Nowhere was included on How Embarrassing Mixtape and official release. Nubomb hosted a second mixtape called How Embarrassing, Vol. 2: Electric Boogaloo.\n\nDuran became obsessed with the recording process resulting in the firing of several producers and Jeff relapsing into substance abuse. Jeff eventually took on the project alone and went broke financially. Producer/rapper Jay Fae described the release as a comedy album that borders on hip hop and conceptual art: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about what happens when you don't become a &quot;Star&quot;, but you still don't want to give up. Duran is more than some lame comic or disc jockey, he is an artist. He learned to rap and pushed himself beyond his comfort level on this.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01e1d3fe9402016c0f2b728b609b89828333647","amp;dn":"Jeff+_JJ+Star_+Duran-How+Embarrassing+%28iTunes+Deluxe+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01e1d3fe9402016c0f2b728b609b89828333647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,30,29,63,233,64,32,22,192,242,183,40,182,9,184,152,40,51,54,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
