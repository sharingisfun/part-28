Distinctive for its highly stylized sets and acting techniques, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari represents both the earliest and the most complete manifestation of German Expressionism in film. Critics have variously characterized it as an extremely influential film that has inspired countless later filmmakers or as an anomaly in film history, a unique work with few imitators.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66b85d23783a3f45d176a6e6407cd764a2864a84","amp;dn":"The.Cabinet.of.Doctor.Caligari.1920.new.soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66b85d23783a3f45d176a6e6407cd764a2864a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,184,93,35,120,58,63,69,209,118,166,230,64,124,215,100,162,134,74,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
