Upheaval\n2. Inhuman Savagery\n3. Slither\n4. Divine Malevolence\n\nBIOGRAPHY:\nDrawing influence from the classic death metal bands of yesteryear as well as the recent breed of modern greats, brutal Sussex quintet Subservience are gathering a good reputation across the country and beyond with their corrosive blend of groove laden extreme metal. You will find no self-indulgent displays here; Subservience put on a stage show that certainly pulls no punches.\n\nTheir live show has earned them a reputation as one of the heaviest bands on the south coast, and has rewarded them with slots at Download Festival 2013 and Hammerfest III, as well as support slots with underground heavyweights Blood Red Throne, Xerath, Mortad, Bloodshot Dawn,Hour of Penance, Demonic Resurrection, Flayed Disciple and Eye of Solitude.\n\nBrimming over with concentrated fury and a taste for chaos, they have been met with a great reception amongst their ever growing fanbase, and the track Exit Wounds has gone on to feature in Metal Hammer magazine (January 2013).\n\nWith new vocalist Dan Lofthouse taking over at the helm in early 2014, the band has written and recorded brand new EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“UpheavalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which they claim is their heaviest effort to date.\n\n\n\n\nPRESS:\n&quot;...Ã¢â‚¬ËœUpheavalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just hard, fast and generally uncompromising Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s positively staggering. As youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top-notch in terms of production values and overall sound, but also in the complexity and quality of the material.&quot; - RealGoneRocks.com\n\n&quot;There is nothing negative to say about this E.P whatsoever. The artwork is just as compelling as the heavy grooves contained within it. The production is finely polished to give the listener 100% quality and the tracks themselves offer resounding brutal death metal played at its utmost best!&quot; 10/10 - Blackenedhorde.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I recommend this E.P wholeheartedly to every death metal fan that reaches the far flung corners of the globe. Brawling with overflowing madness it constantly feeds the emotions with equal persuasion that ignites vehemently with passion and energy!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 5/5 - Brutalism.com\n\n&quot;A new member can really have an impact on a band, especially when it's the vocalist, and that's what Dan Lofthouse appears to have done for Subservience on their latest self-released EP. Having joined this year, his style is in keeping with their groove-induced death metal, as it adds a further sense of despair to these four tracks. That's not to take anything away from the rest of the British band, who form some absorbing extremity that's indebted to Carcass, Bolt Thrower and all the usuals. There are enough unique segments for this to be more than a tribute work, though.&quot; 3.5/5 - Zero Tolerance Magazine\n\n\nFor more information please visit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.subservience.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.subservience.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tGroove Death Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t43.53 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n5 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e2d576e88eedefcb44c61837cba9436de7b27b","amp;dn":"Subservience+-+Upheaval+%28EP%29+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e2d576e88eedefcb44c61837cba9436de7b27b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,226,213,118,232,142,237,239,203,68,198,24,55,203,169,67,109,231,178,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
