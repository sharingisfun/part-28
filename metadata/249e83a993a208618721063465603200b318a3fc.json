Although he has spent the better part of his life in juvenile detention, this stint is his first in an adult prison. Beyond the division of Corsicans and Muslims in the prison (the Corsicans who with their guard connections rule what happens in the prison), he has no known friends or enemies inside. He is just hoping to serve his time in peace and without incident, despite having no prospects once he's out of jail since he's illiterate and has no support outside of the prison. Due to logistics, the head of Corsican inmates, a sadistic mafioso named CÃƒÂ©sar Luciani, co-opts Malik as part of the Corsicans' activities, not only regarding what happens inside the prison, but also continued criminal activities outside. The innocent Malik has no idea what to do but cooperate.\n\n\nLanguages: French / Arabic / Corsican\n\nSubs srt: English / Portuguese / Spanish ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249e83a993a208618721063465603200b318a3fc","amp;dn":"Un+Prophete+2009+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249e83a993a208618721063465603200b318a3fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,158,131,169,147,162,8,97,135,33,6,52,101,96,50,0,179,24,163,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
