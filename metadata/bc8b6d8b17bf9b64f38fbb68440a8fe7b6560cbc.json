His goal was to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States for the Spanish crown and, in the process, become as wealthy and famous as HernÃƒÂ¡n CortÃƒÂ©s.\n \nBut from the moment the NarvÃƒÂ¡ez expedition landed in Florida, it faced perilÃ¢â‚¬â€navigational errors, disease, starvation, as well as resistance from indigenous tribes. Within a year there were only four survivors: the expeditionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treasurer, Ãƒï¿½lvar NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez Cabeza de Vaca; a Spanish nobleman named Alonso del Castillo Maldonado; a young explorer named AndrÃƒÂ©s Dorantes de Carranza; and DorantesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Moroccan slave, Mustafa al-Zamori, whom the three Spaniards called Estebanico. These four survivors would go on to make a journey across America that would transform them from proud conquis-tadores to humble servants, from fearful outcasts to faith healers.\n \nThe MoorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Account brilliantly captures EstebanicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice and vision, giving us an alternate narrative for this famed expedition. As the dramatic chronicle unfolds, we come to understand that, contrary to popular belief, black men played a significant part in New World exploration and Native American men and women were not merely silent witnesses to it. In Laila LalamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deft hands, EstebanicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir illuminates the ways in which stories can transmigrate into history, even as storytelling can offer a chance for redemption and survival","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8b6d8b17bf9b64f38fbb68440a8fe7b6560cbc","amp;dn":"The+Moor%27s+Account+by+Laila+Lalami+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8b6d8b17bf9b64f38fbb68440a8fe7b6560cbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,139,109,139,23,191,155,100,243,143,187,104,68,10,143,231,182,86,12,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
