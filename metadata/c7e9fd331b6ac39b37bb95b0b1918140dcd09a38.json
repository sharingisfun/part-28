(or as I like to say) Take a Witch to the Sky Way ..... \n\n\n+ This Hole is comprised of frontwoman/guitarist/singer/provocarockateur Courtney Love, guitarist Eric Erlandson, bassist/backing vocalist Melissa auf der Maur, and drummer Patty Schemel +\n\n\nThis blessed lossless mess of sweet acoustic goodness, spiced with just the right amount of electric badass bonus is bitchin bliss.\n\nI watched my MTV the night this show debuted. Hole aired out my hole in the wall back in the winter of 1995. \n\nI had never before heard &quot;Best Sunday Dress.&quot; I more than likely had to pick my jaw up off the floor for the first time of the night with that one. \n\nWhen it all came down to &quot;Drown Soda,&quot; the small bootleg world had already got coldcocked with the holy almighty shit c/o the BBC back in 1991. \n\nFlash forward back to &quot;Happy Fucking Valentines Day! '95, with her brand new big gulp of Drown Sod, Courtney is now crossing the universe off her list. \n\nBut that this all only came after Kurt had left it all behind. ...Fuck.\n\nStill worth living for : Something Wicked This Way Comes Undone Soon : Check out this unplugged companion upload from yesteryear once more.  &quot;Hole - 1995-04-26, Virgin Megastore, London UK [AUD]&quot; The sound there cannot at all match MTV Unplugged, and there are no musical guests sitting in. But the set is better than good. It is faster and looser, a hotter show. Two-and-a-half months after Valentines Day, many more acoustic promo-gigs later, Hole had it in for us even more. \n\nWhy then you must witness to the still missing number from MTV Unplugged, &quot;Drunk In Rio&quot; aka &quot;Closing Time.&quot; That like-a-virgin song does make the cut at Virgin Megastore. The song is written by Kurt, Kristen and Courtney. She dedicates it &quot;to both of them who are not around anymore, well actually all three of 'em.&quot; \n\n...Right between the eyes of my heart. &quot;Closing Time&quot; makes it on time at last, closing down that show with no mercy.\n\nBut that's another Sugar Coma for another day away. Back to her first Valentines Day without Kurt. And our first Valentines Day to go with her without him, too. \n\nAnd here we are now going out of our heads inside our hearts still with her.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAssorted Artetc. Samples : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/pdvd024nc8-1.jpg~original&quot;
