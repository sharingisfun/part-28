He clings to the lower rungs of society, struggling to pay rent and obey the strict laws of society. Then one night he captures Cali, a human runaway. \n\nDraven must return the girl, but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop thinking about her. He returns to feed on her often and begins to remember his own humanity as he spends more time with her. As he learns to sympathize with the human and see her as more than an animal, he struggles to protect her from other Superiors. But Draven canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep others from feeding on Cali unless he buys her. He vows to make the purchase, no matter what he has to sacrifice to support a human. \n\nHis quest for Cali starts innocently enough, but soon leads him deeper into a tangled web of danger, violence, betrayal and murder.\n\nGenre: Fantasy | Vampire","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1601435366eb72cb632f56d5d84f8e529780249","amp;dn":"The+Superiors+by+Lena+Hillbrand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1601435366eb72cb632f56d5d84f8e529780249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,96,20,53,54,110,183,44,182,50,245,109,93,132,248,229,41,120,2,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
