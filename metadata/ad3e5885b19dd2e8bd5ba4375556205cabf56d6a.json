The cover of the original record\nopens to three sides, holding the record like a card.\nStyle: \tAfro Brazilian-Jazz.\nComments: \t \n\nBrazilOnGuitar says: Baden is an outtake album from the Tristeza on Guitar sessions in July 1966. They are alternative takes with slight variations e.g. in Das Rosas or Round Midnight and unused songs like Canto de Ossanha or Lamento, one title was named differently. They have a very different sound. The SABA recording sound have a stronger bass sound, probably according to the musical taste of producer Joachim E. Berendt. The sound of the Brazilian Elenco pressing sounds more intimate and personal, without the strong bass sound on all instruments.\n\nThus it is not a simple re-pressing of the famous SABA record, but shows a certain independence, reaching uniqueness. This is emphasised by using rare pictures, Baden Powell ether with Herbie Mann, who did not take part in the recording session, and a less typical PR picture showing Baden doing a chord spanning six frets.\n\nBaden is a well-done outtake album, unfortunately the only in his discography. BOG recommends listening to both recordings, if possible the Japanese CD version of Tristeza on Guitar and the Baden-reissue from 2003 (whose tracklist is wrong, Sarava instead if Samba de Bencao, furthermore there is a graphical mistake in the front cover).\n\nWe thank Robert G.
