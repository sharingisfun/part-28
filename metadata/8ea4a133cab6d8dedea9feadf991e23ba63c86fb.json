This indicates where the emphasis is placed when the word is pronounced. Words with only one syllable remain unstressed.\nIn Greek, every letter corresponds to one distinct sound. There are a few exceptions that Rosetta Stone will help you learn.\nThere are three genders, or categories, of Greek nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter.\nGreek noun, adjective, and pronoun endings change depending on their position in the sentence, their gender, and whether they are singular or plural.\nIn Greek, the pronoun is usually dropped from sentences because its meaning is conveyed by the ending of the verbs. Pronouns are used mainly for emphasis.\nTo convey politeness, Greek speakers will use the plural form of a verb.\nIn written Greek, a question is followed by a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ punctuation marker.\nThis set will help you:\n\nBuild your vocabulary and language abilities\nSpell and write accurately\nSpeak without a script\nRetain what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned\nRead and understand your new language\nShare ideas and opinions, express feelings and talk about everyday life\nSample topics include:\n\nThe basics, such as age and family relations\nQuestions, greetings, introductions\nTimes of day, calendar terms, the weather\nDirections, locations, telling time\nPresent, past and future tense\nApologies and polite requests\nHow to order at a restaurant and give and receive directions\nEmotions, opinions and ideas\nPolitical, media, business and religious terms\nRequirements for Rosetta Stone User Workstations\n\nWindows 2000 or later\nMac OS 10.4 or later\n512 MB RAM\n1 GHz or faster processor speed\n600 MB free hard-drive space (per level)\n16-bit sound card\n800 x 600 display resolution (1024 x 768 recommended)\nInternet or phone connection required for product activation\nSpeech recognition feature requires a USB headset microphone (included with purchase)\n16X CD-ROM Drive (for installation)\nNote for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ users:\n\nCurrent Rosetta Stone products have been engineered to install and run on the Windows Vista operating system.
