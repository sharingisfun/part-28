The band has two albums out on Dare to Care Records.\nA group of high school friends from Sorel, Quebec, the band made itself known in 2004 with the release of its first album, Le Compte complet. Critics welcomed the disc with positive reviews, which allowed the group to become instantly famous in the QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cois music scene. Several of its songs, such as &quot;Le MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tronome&quot; and &quot;La ValÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rie&quot;, were prominent mainstays on several QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec radio stations. For the production of the album, the group turned to Martin Pelland from fellow Montreal band The Dears.\nIn the months that followed the release of their first album, Malajube launched a tour across QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec, participating in several major festivals, such as Les FrancoFolies de MontrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©al.\nIn February 2006, the quartet released its second album, Trompe-l&amp;#039;Ãƒâ€¦?il, which also received a warm welcome on the part of QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec media. Collaborations with singer Pierre Lapointe, QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©becois rap group Loco Locass, and the use of a wide variety of instruments has contributed to the album&amp;#039;s success in addition to audio engineer/record producer Ryan Battistuzzi&amp;#039;s (We Are Wolves, Death from Above 1979, Blessed By A Broken Heart) production work.[1] Trompe-l&amp;#039;Ãƒâ€¦?il also began to attract attention in English Canada in July, when it was shortlisted for the inaugural Polaris Music Prize, and in the United States in October, when it was a featured review on Pitchfork Media. In 2006, they won three FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lix Awards at the 28th edition of the Gala de l&amp;#039;ADISQ: two for Trompe-lÃƒÂ¢??Ãƒâ€¦?il, &quot;Best alternative album&quot; and &quot;Best cover art&quot; while they were proclaimed &quot;Revelation of the year 2006&quot;. CBC has described them as one of very few QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec musical groups who have achieved success in English Canada despite not performing in English, something the band states they have no interest in doing.\nOn October 17, 2006, Malajube released their CD Trompe-lÃƒÂ¢??Ãƒâ€¦?il in the U.S. They also participated in the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City on November 2, 2006.\nThe band&amp;#039;s song &quot;Montreal -40Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C&quot; was featured in a Rogers Wireless commercial, and another song, &quot;Ton Plat Favori&quot;, was in a Zellers commercial. PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢te filo was also featured in a commercial for Radio Shack in the United States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c2b54f5f55c9679ec8f621a9383ee8b510bd17","amp;dn":"Malajube+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c2b54f5f55c9679ec8f621a9383ee8b510bd17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,194,181,79,95,85,201,103,158,200,246,33,169,56,62,232,181,16,189,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
