The practical sections of the book clearly cover the different parts of the massage process, and color photos and graphics provide clear explanations to help learners utilize the techniques with confidence. The book also covers the history and theory behind Thai foot massage, including discussions about the reflex points on the feet and the concept of Sen (energy) lines that flow throughout the body, to help explain how this ancient healing art works. Though Thai foot massage is not a curative in itself, the featured techniques can promote general health and well-being.\n\n\n\nNote: Used Aldiko for the epub file and Kindle for the mobi file on my Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model)\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e16d5971ad9cb6d2aa2b770a4b56a964f26d5d3b","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Thai+Foot+Massage+ebook+Simon+Piers+Gall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e16d5971ad9cb6d2aa2b770a4b56a964f26d5d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,109,89,113,173,156,182,210,170,43,119,10,75,86,169,100,242,109,93,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
