This is wild stuff, so check it out if you\\'ve never heard this sort of music before. The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing almost none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs.\n\nAGP1-157 are available for direct download at\n\nAGP163-173 are now available at http://ubu.com/sound/agp/index.html.\n\nAGP169-173 are also available at http://thepiratebay.se/user/human2011.\n\nNOTE: All of the AGP installments since 163 are 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files. The extra bits of quantization reveal more realistic detail using a 24-bit DAC and good audio equipment. To burn these tracks to CD, you will first have to convert them to 16-bit files. This is easily done using the converter tool in Foobar2000 or other software.\n\n=======================================\n\nAGP174 is the first of an occasional series of new 24-bit transcriptions of LPs included in earlier AGP installments, using the Linn Akiva phono cartridge and Linn Ekos SE tonearm that I added to my system after transcribing AGP157. The new cartridge/tonearm combination improves resolution of detail and decreases tracking distortion. 24-bit quantization produces a more natural sound with more of a sense of acoustic space than the 16-bit quantization that was used for earlier AGP installments because it is the CD standard. \n\nThe LP transcribed for this installment was the basis for AGP7, featuring the music of Ezra Sims, an American composer who rebelled against the tonal impurities of well-tempered tuning and developed his own 18-note scale based on a division of the octave into 72 intervals. This heterodox scale enabled him to compose for more purely tuned intervals, as well as to explore microtonality. The tuning of these pieces takes some getting used to, but it considerably expands the range of harmonies that Sims is able to exploit. \n\nThe first three pieces are written for violin alone, violin and viola, and viola alone. The spare instrumentations facilitate one\\'s introduction to Sims\\' idiosyncratic tuning. The last is for a sextet of violin, viola, cello, clarinet, saxophone, and french horn. These four compositions make up Northeastern Records NR 224. Other recordings of Sims\\' works on CD are available through www.newworldrecords.org, including recordings of all of the other Sims pieces I could find in my stacks. The installment includes a TXT file with the liner notes from the LP release.\n\nEquipment used for A/D conversion: Linn Akiva phono cartridge, Linn LP12/Lingo turntable, Linn Ekos SE tonearm, Audioquest LeoPard tonearm cable, PS Audio PS2 preamplifier, Kimber PBJ interconnect, M-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter.\n\n01 - all done from memory [7:49]\n02 - two for one [11:47]\n03 - and as I was saying [5:35]\n04 - sextet [21:53]\n\nNOTE: To the best of my knowledge, these recordings are not currently available commercially. If you know otherwise, please let me know ASAP, as I do not wish any artists to be deprived of the royalties that they so richly deserve.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81e4df64b33429b24c9a2171a673e2fdd51d3c4","amp;dn":"Ezra+Sims+-+microtonal+music+%28Avant+Garde+Project+174%29+24%2F44","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81e4df64b33429b24c9a2171a673e2fdd51d3c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,30,77,246,75,51,66,155,36,201,162,23,26,103,62,47,221,81,211,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
