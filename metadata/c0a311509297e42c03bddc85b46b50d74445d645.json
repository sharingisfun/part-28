It featured the adventures of the eponymous group of mutant superheroes, a group of teenagers led and taught by Professor Xavier.\n\nThe book was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, met with a lukewarm reception, and was eventually cancelled in 1970. Interest was rekindled with 1975's Giant-Size X-Men and the debut of a new, international team. Under the guidance of David Cockrum &amp; Chris Claremont, whose 16-year stint began with August 1975's Uncanny X-Men #94, the series grew in popularity worldwide, eventually spawning a franchise with numerous spin-off &quot;X-books&quot;, including New Mutants, X-Factor, Excalibur, X-Force, Generation X, the simply titled X-Men, and a number of prefixed titles such as Astonishing X-Men and New X-Men.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a311509297e42c03bddc85b46b50d74445d645","amp;dn":"Uncanny+X-Men","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a311509297e42c03bddc85b46b50d74445d645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,163,17,80,146,151,228,44,3,189,220,133,180,107,80,215,68,69,214,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
