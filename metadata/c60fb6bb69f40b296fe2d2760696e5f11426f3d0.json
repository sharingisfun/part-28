There are dozens of yoga styles to choose from, and while yoga is for everyone, not every style is the perfect fit for every person. But how do you choose between mysterious-sounding names such as Ashtanga, Kundalini, Bikram, and Kripalu? As Meagan McCrary discovered when she began exploring different classes, finding the right style is essential for establishing a steady yoga practice. Pick Your Yoga Practice is the first book to describe the most prominent yoga styles in depth, including teaching methodology, elements of practice, philosophical and spiritual underpinnings, class structure, physical exertion, and personal attention. Those new to yoga will discover they have options and can confidently attend a class of their choosing, while experienced practitioners will expand their understanding of the vast world of modern yoga, and perhaps find themselves venturing into new territory.\n\nStyles included:\n\nAshtanga * Iyengar * Kundalini * Integral * Kripalu\nBikram * Jivamukti * Sivananda * Ananda\nViniyoga * Svaroopa * Power * Forrest * ISHTA\nAnusara * Moksha * AcroYoga\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://galleryplus.ebayimg.com/ws/web/360803638183_1_0_1/1000x1000.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://galleryplus.ebayimg.com/ws/web/360803638183_1_0_1/1000x1000.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/cc/73/61220250e51a0a7f02358d.L._V169476909_SY470_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/cc/73/61220250e51a0a7f02358d.L._V169476909_SY470_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMeagan McCrary is a certified yoga instructor and journalist.
