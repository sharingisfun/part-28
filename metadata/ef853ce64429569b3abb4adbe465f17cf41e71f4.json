Fly from space to your neighborhood. Type in an address and zoom right in. Search for schools, parks, restaurants, and hotels. Get driving directions. Tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings. Save and share your searches and favorites. Even add your own annotations. Google Earth lets you do smooth sailing flybyes of the entire Earth. You can easily fly to any spot on the globe, by entering any associated data, like street addresses, place names or lat/long coordinates. There are overlays that put additional information on the map, like roads, international boundaries, terrain, 3D buildings, crime statistics, schools, stadiums, any number of interesting stuff. You can do Local searches in the program, with icons on the map and a display on the side showing your results. You can leave notes, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“placemarksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ all over the map, so you can remember where all sorts of places are. Searches and placemarks can be saved as bookmarks in Ã¢â‚¬Å“My PlacesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Everything can be output in an XML format called KML, that will allow the vast popularity of Google Maps to continue in Earth. You can also email a JPEG of the map, or send a KMZ file if you know the recipient has Earth installed.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Sophisticated streaming technology delivers the data to you as you need it.\n    Imagery and 3D data depict the entire earth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Terabytes of aerial and satellite imagery depict cities around the world in high-resolution detail.\n    Local search lets you search for restaurants, hotels, and even driving directions.
