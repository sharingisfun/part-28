Today there is an Annual Culinary Olympics, with hundreds of cooks from many countries ardently competing. But we who hate to cook have had our own Olympics for years, seeing who can get out of the kitchen the fastest and stay out the longest.&quot;\n- Peg Bracken\n\nPhilosopher's Chowder. Skinny Meatloaf. Fat Man's Shrimp. Immediate Fudge Cake. These are just a few of the beloved recipes from Peg Bracken's classic I HATE TO COOK BOOK. Written in a time when women were expected to have full, delicious meals on the table for their families every night, Peg Bracken offered women who didn't revel in this obligation an alternative: quick, simple meals that took minimal effort but would still satisfy.\n\n50 years later, times have certainly changed - but the appeal of THE I HATE TO COOK BOOK hasn't.\n\nThis book is for everyone, men and women alike, who wants to get from cooking hour to cocktail hour in as little time as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8ff957b0606027c408c8351a00ca726a05bd4f","amp;dn":"The+I+Hate+to+Cook+Book%3A+50th+Anniversary+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8ff957b0606027c408c8351a00ca726a05bd4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,143,249,87,176,96,96,39,196,8,200,53,26,0,202,114,106,5,189,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
