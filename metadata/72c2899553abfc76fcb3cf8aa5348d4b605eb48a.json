Got a Ukelele \n\nAfter 40 years and two nominations, Loudon Wainwright III finally got his Grammy in 2010 with High, Wide and Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project. And if this opportunistic follow-up doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t match the breadth and depth of that whole-hearted tribute to one of countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forgotten pioneers, it has its own bumptious charms.\n\nWhatever interpretive strides Wainwright may have taken (2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Recovery even found him rejigging his own older stuff), 10 Songs for the New Depression is back to business as usual. This is Loudon Wainwright the rueful vaudevillian, his narrative voice familiar from decades of satirical whimsies and wry confessions.\n\nThe ostensible theme is 21st century recession, equated to the 1930s by some cute cover art and two songs from the earlier period. The American has never been a populist, though (his one real hit, 1972ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dead Skunk, became a career embarrassment that maybe only the late-arriving Grammy has dispelled), and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no parallel here to Woody GuthrieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s empathetic tramp through the Dust Bowl.\n\nFar from it. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConsider yourselves strung along,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Wainwright tells his listeners in Times Is Hard; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll I can do is play this song.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The songwriterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s satirical inclinations have always played second fiddle to his introspection, and whether heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s identifying with a newspaper columnistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s angst (The Krugman Blues) or updating On to Victory, Mr Roosevelt with cynical irony, the economyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got him flummoxed.\n\nNot that this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t appealing. Partly itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the attack and colour Wainwright wrings from his acoustic guitar, drawing with imagination on a folksy musical palette every bit as old as himself. Partly itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the fables and punch lines he whittles out of his down-your-street observations.\n\nBut most of all itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the fact that a rankled Loudon Wainwright generates more energy than a small wind farm, and a good deal more humour.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou know that job I always said that I hated?\nWell yesterday they gave me the sack.\nLoving your work is so damn overrated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nI sure wish to God I had that job back!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c2899553abfc76fcb3cf8aa5348d4b605eb48a","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III...10+Songs+for+the+New+Depression%282010%29%5BFL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c2899553abfc76fcb3cf8aa5348d4b605eb48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,194,137,149,83,171,252,118,252,179,207,138,165,52,141,75,96,94,180,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
