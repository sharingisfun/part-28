It provides the reader with annotated, critically examined, and compiled data for such materials. The data includes a variety of thermochemical, structural, and transport properties. The book includes correlations of measured properties; these correlations should enable the reader to estimate, on a sound basis, properties for ionic liquids that have not yet been measured","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17f43f30146024410a49ce5145ea9ffa8219bb4","amp;dn":"Ionic+Liquid+Properties+-+From+Molten+Salts+to+RTILs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17f43f30146024410a49ce5145ea9ffa8219bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,127,67,243,1,70,2,68,16,164,156,229,20,94,169,255,168,33,155,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
