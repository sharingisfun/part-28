Fortunately some video players can still enlarge the\npicture to full-screen with no loss in quality, and the picture is\nsharp and clear!  Also he did these as MKV files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979f081a2fc97db9b997a095b5fc5fab6b3e2baf","amp;dn":"BUDGIE+--+Out+%28+pilot+episode+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979f081a2fc97db9b997a095b5fc5fab6b3e2baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,159,8,26,47,201,125,185,185,151,160,149,181,252,95,171,107,62,43,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
