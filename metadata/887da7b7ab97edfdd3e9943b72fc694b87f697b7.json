One of the songs was performed by Tupac Shakur, who would be the subject of a documentary with a soundtrack produced by Eminem, who also produced a posthumous album by Tupac. The album also features four songs by the Wu-Tang Clan and its members, and two songs by Mobb Deep, who eventually signed to G-Unit Records, headed by Shady Records artist 50 Cent.
