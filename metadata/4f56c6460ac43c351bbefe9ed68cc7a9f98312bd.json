This album was published just a few months ago however because I have no money to my  name, especially after dishing out a grand for Hollywood Strings earlier this year, I lack funds to publish it with a label. So here I am with Pirate Bay, an endeavor I support, offering my music for free. I always accept donations, however that is only if you want to. Here is a list of tracks from the album, as well as some other useless rubbish you may not want. Enjoy!\n\n1 - A New Beginning\n2 - Affinity\n3 - Home\n4 - Into the Breach\n5 - Moving Target\n6 - Separated\n7 - Fallen Herald\n8 - Like Footprints in the Wind\n9 - A Raven's Chilled Wings\n10 - Battle Fleet\n11 - Incendiary\n12 - Never Forgotten\n13 - Epitaph\n14 - The Journey\n15 - The Tarsus Project\n16 - Welcome to Astorath\n17 - Fallen Herald (Alternate)\n18 - Back in Action\n19 - Ithaca Down\n20 - The Graduate\n\nThere is also some album art and two additional scores that aren't listed. They were composed after the first album was published. \n\nThere is a MP3 version going up as well, and should be available shortly. Just look under the same name, Fractal and you should find it easily. \n\nYou can reach me on my soundcloud if you would like to use any of this music in a project of yours, or would like to request a type of music be made. (Let me say in advance, I am adverse to electronic/dubstep, so do not ask. I do organic music only with the occasional drone effect and electric drums). \n\n\nCheers!\n\n - Grady","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f56c6460ac43c351bbefe9ed68cc7a9f98312bd","amp;dn":"Fractal+Music+-+Fractal+-+2013+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f56c6460ac43c351bbefe9ed68cc7a9f98312bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,86,198,70,10,196,60,53,27,190,254,158,214,140,199,169,249,131,18,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
