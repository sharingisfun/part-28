Torq is not bound by the\nlimits of hardwareit embraces the technology of todays most advanced audio\nproduction applications and integrates with them in a fashion that makes you\npart of the music. Exercising this level of control upon your collection of\nsongs is a task that has many facets, and Torq addresses each of these with a\nspecialized array of controls and features. This section provides an overview\nof these features and how they contribute to your arsenal of digital mixing\ntools and techniques.\n\nDJing begins with music, so you will get to know Torqs Decks very well. A\nDeck is what Torq uses to play back a single digital music file and is\nanalogous to the turntable or CD player used by DJs. The Deck allows you to\nplay a track, change its speed and its key, as well as rearrange the track by\nlooping and jumping to new locations within the song. Torq is equipped with\ntwo of these Decksone on each side of the screen.\n\nMain Waveform Display\n\nOne of the wonderful benefits of computer technology is the ability to\nvisualize audio. While interesting to the eyes in their own right, waveform\ndisplays are an invaluable tool when DJing. Torqs user interface is dominated\nby two such waveforms at the top-center of the screen, with one corresponding\nto each of the Decks. Use these scrolling waveforms to check the\nsynchronization of tracks, locate sounds, predict breakdowns, and much more.\n\nMixer\n\nIts all in the mix, or so they say, and Torqs Mixer delivers the goods. The\nMixer takes the audio from the two Decks and gives you control over what can\nbe heard by means of volume controls, audio equalizers, and a crossfader. Two\nDecks and a Mixer: the essential tools for a DJ.\n\nPFL/Headphone Cue\n\nDJs commonly listen to a track on their headphones without letting their\naudience hear it. This allows them to match the tempo of the new song to the\ncurrent one, along with finding the correct starting position for the song.\nTorq allows you to monitor either Deck on headphones, and also features a\nstereo headphone split normally reserved for high-quality DJ mixers.\n\nBrowser/Database\n\nThere is a third ingredient to DJing, and thats musiclots of music. To help\nyou stay on top of your massive music collection, Torq features a Database for\ncataloging and searching tracks. It monitors your favorite folders and allows\nyou to create playlists for future performances.\n\nEffect Racks\n\nEffects are a great way for you to manipulate (or mangle) your music in unique\nways to enhance your mix. Torq has a collection of built-in effects that are\nspecifically designed for DJ use: Tempo-synced delays and strobes. Shimmering\nphasers and flangers. Glitchy repeats and distortions. Ten effects are ready\nto go and full of creative potential. You can use up to three of these effects\non each Deck, and you can also expand your collection using widely-available\nVST plug-ins.\n\nSnapshots\n\nDJing is done with the hands, but you may find that your mind wants to hear\nmore than your two hands are capable of. To surmount this obstacle, Torq\nallows you to combine multiple movements, such as button presses and knob\ntweaks, into one grand gesture called a Snapshot that can be triggered by a\nsingle keypress. Torq manages a collection of Snapshots that can be recalled\ninterchangeably, even in rapid succession. The Snapshots can even be layered\ntogether to create massive changes in your mix.\n\nMaster Section\n\nWhen all is tweaked and mixed to perfection, the resultant audio is sent to\nthe Master Output. Torq features an automatic output limiter that will keep\nyour music from distorting as well as a module for recording the final mix to\na file as you play. You can then burn the results onto a CD or convert them to\nMP3 for podcasts.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.m-audio.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.m-audio.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1.
