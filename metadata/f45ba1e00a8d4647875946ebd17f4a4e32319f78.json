Released in 1940, it was a box office sensation across Germany and Europe; alongside the movie's theatrical distribution, it became a staple of Nazi propaganda evenings organized by the Hitler Youth, SS and others. At once a rousing melodrama and murderous antisemitic incitement, the movie draws loosely from historical events from the early eighteenth century, when Jud SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss Oppenheimer, financial advisor to the Duke of WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rttemberg, was subjected to a sensational trial and gruesome execution. The film depicts SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss as a figure of cynical cunning and malign will, a sexual predator sowing corruption everywhere; his promotion of Jewish emancipation brings Christian WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rttemberg to the brink of moral and social ruination. That these qualities are conveyed through Ferdinand Marian's stunningly charismatic performance as SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss suggests something of the film's disturbing power even as it acknowledges Jewish misery, Jud SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss argues for still more lethal, pitiless solutions to the Jewish question. A key historical document of the twentieth century, Jud SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss remains a deeply unsettling cinematic experience. Directed by Veit Harlan; music by Wolfgang Zeller; featuring Ferdinand Marian, Werner Krauss, Heinrich George, and Kristina SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶derbaum. Germany, 1940, B&amp;W, 95 minutes, German dialogue, Switchable English, Hungarian, French &amp; Italian subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45ba1e00a8d4647875946ebd17f4a4e32319f78","amp;dn":"Jud+S%C3%83%C2%BC%C3%83%C5%B8+%2F+Jew+Suess+DVD5+NTSC+ISO+%28ITA%2C+HUN%2C+ENG%2C+FRA+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45ba1e00a8d4647875946ebd17f4a4e32319f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,91,161,224,10,141,70,71,135,89,70,235,209,127,74,78,50,49,159,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
