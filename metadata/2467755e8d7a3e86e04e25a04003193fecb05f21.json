He was famous for singing Russian folk songs, but also performed opera, light classics and folk songs from many other countries. He was known on stage for his gusto. He performed over 6,000 concerts in his career, including a two-year seven-day-a-week stint at the French opera, singing, among other greats, Fiddler on the Roof. Rebroff still performed 12 shows in 14 days when he was well into his seventies, such as on an Australian tour.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2467755e8d7a3e86e04e25a04003193fecb05f21","amp;dn":"Ivan+Rebroff.+%C3%90%CB%9C%C3%90%C2%B2%C3%90%C2%B0%C3%90%C2%BD+%C3%90%C2%A0%C3%90%C2%B5%C3%90%C2%B1%C3%91%E2%82%AC%C3%90%C2%BE%C3%90%C2%B2+%28russian+folk+music%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2467755e8d7a3e86e04e25a04003193fecb05f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,103,117,94,141,122,62,134,224,78,37,160,64,3,25,63,236,176,95,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
