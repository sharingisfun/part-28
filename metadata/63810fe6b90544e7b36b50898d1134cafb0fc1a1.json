These compound classes form the basis for the development of many new materials for various applications. The series covers biomaterials, nanomaterials, polymeric nanofibers and electrospun materials, polymer hybrids, conducting polymers, composite materials from macro- to nano-scale, and many more; from fundamentals, over the synthesis and development of the new materials, to their applications. The authored or edited books in this series address researchers and professionals, academic and industrial chemists involved in the areas of Polymer Science and the development of new Materials. They cover aspects such as the chemistry, physics, characterization, and material science of Polymers, and Polymer and Composite Materials. The books in this series can serve a growing demand for concise and comprehensive treatments of specific topics in this rapidly growing field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63810fe6b90544e7b36b50898d1134cafb0fc1a1","amp;dn":"Springer+Series+on+Polymer+and+Composite+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63810fe6b90544e7b36b50898d1134cafb0fc1a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,129,15,230,185,5,68,231,179,107,80,137,141,17,52,202,251,15,193,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
