ESET Smart Security 4 represents a complex security solution for computers, which was improved and optimized to provide superior performance and small footprint simultaneously. ESET Smart Security 4 is created by a symbiosis of previously known and newly added features. These advanced technologies in combination with ESETÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s famous Proactive Protection ensure comprehensive protection against viruses, trojans, worms, adware, spyware, phishing, rootkits. In other words, ESET Smart Security 4 is the result of ESETÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s continuous quest for perfection in computer protection.\n\nThe four main modules (Antivirus, Antispyware, Personal Firewall and Anti-Spam) were optimized to provide even better integrated protection by maintaining a high level of performance and speed simultaneously.\n\nIncluded is also ESETÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s famous Advanced Heuristics to protect from unknown threats and generic signatures for reliable detection of mutations of known viruses. ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®.NET technology minimize the vulnerability window after the virus outbreak and make the smart detection concept of ESET complete.\n\nMain modules \n\n    * Antivirus\n    * Antispyware\n    * Personal Firewall\n    * Antispam\n\n \nOther technologies\n\n \nThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®\n\nTraditional, signature-based security solutions only react to known threats. The problem is that signature based solutions can only detect known attacks with identification signatures that need to be available in the usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ system at the time of the attack, which often takes a few hours. With the speed the new malware can spread today, the risk that you become a victim of a new, so far unknown infiltration is too real. The solution of ESET is based upon the unique ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology utilizing a new generation of advanced heuristics. This technology offers proactive protection against newest infiltrations in the early hours of their spreading, while the experts in ESETÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s labs work on creating of a new signature which is to be added to the virus signatures database of NOD32.\n\n    * Anti-Stealth technology against rootkits\n    * Protection against phishing attacks\n    * SysInspector\n\n \nKey benefits\n\n    * Protection from the Unknown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Award-winning ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology delivers the most effective protection against new attacks on the market.\n    * Built for Speed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ESETÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solutions are lightning fast, delivering superior scanning performance.\n    * Easy on System Resources ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ESET typically uses only 35-40MB of system memory, a fraction of what other products consume. Laptop users will welcome the new automatic energy-conserving battery mode.\n    * Easy on You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ more user friendly than ever before ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from  the compact and intuitive interface, the minimal use of alerts, to self-training firewall ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you will be up and running in a snap,  hardly noticing the solution quietly working in the background.\n\n \nNew features\n\n \n\n    * Self-Defense ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a built-in technology to prevent malicious software from corrupting or disabling the systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s security.\n    * SysRescue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ allows user to create computer recovery medium on a CD and USB key for system boot-up.\n    * Portable media access control, including USB, CD, flash disc, closing this vector of potential malware infiltration.\n    * Encrypted communication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ developed for Windows XP and Windows Vista to scan HTTPs and POP3s protocols for malware. Included is also the so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlearning mode,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for the state-of-the-art firewall, affording even greater level of protection.\n    * Support of More E-mail clients,  including Windows Mail, Windows Live Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird\n    * Non-Graphical User Interface with the option to switch automatically to high contrast mode when in Windows.\n    * Smart Optimalization ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ function permitting increase in the scanning speed\n    * Integrated ESET SysInspector ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a powerful diagnostic tool for in-depth analysis of the operating system, including running processes, registry content, startup items and network connections.\n    * Integrated Anti-StealthÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ advanced technology to protect against rootkits\n\nESET Smart Security 4\n(Microsoft Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7/Vista/XP/2000 - 32bit)\nversion: 4.0.467, size: 36 MB\n\nESET Smart Security 4\n(Microsoft Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7/Vista/XP - 64bit)\nversion: 4.0.467, size: 38 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3571d36f7094a300954ea8d143359a2e804fc3bd","amp;dn":"ESET+Smart+Security+4.0.467-For+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3571d36f7094a300954ea8d143359a2e804fc3bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,113,211,111,112,148,163,0,149,78,168,209,67,53,154,46,128,79,195,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
