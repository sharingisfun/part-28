Surah Al-Baqara (The Calf)\nArabic and English translation and transliteration\n\n\nPeriod of Revelation\nMedina (except the last 3 verses which were revealed in Mecca).\n\nIntroduction\nThis surah is the longest surah in the Quran and contains the longest verse in the Qur'an (2:282). The name references verses 67--73 which recall the story of the golden calf worshipped as an idol by the Israelites during Moses' absence.\nThe theme of Surah Baqarah is divided into two parts: 1) Bani Israel - and talks about the first enemy of Islam \n(The Jews) and then 2) Pillars of Islam and Eeman.\nOther notable passages include the famous Ayat Al-Kursi or &quot;Throne Verse&quot;, as well as the closing two verses which outline the six articles of belief before forming a prayer for forgiveness, divine mercy, and help against enemies of faith.\nThe surah addresses a wide variety of topics, including substantial amounts of law, and retells stories of Adam, Abraham and Moses. A major theme is guidance: urging the pagans (Al-Kuffar) and the Jews of Medina to embrace Islam, and warning them and the hypocrites of the fate God had visited in the past on those who failed to heed His call.\nHadith: It is reported from 'Uqbah Ibn 'Amir Al-Juhani that he said that Muhammad said: &quot;Recite the last two verses from Surat Al-Baqarah, for I was given them from a treasure trove beneath the Throne&quot; (Ahmad)\n\n\nEnglish Translation: Sahih International\nArabic Reciter: Mishari ibn Rashid al-`Afasy\nEnglish Reciter: Ibrahim Walk\nText: Quran.com: http://quran.com/02\nDownload MP3's: http://quranicaudio.com/download/quran/58\n\nThe Meaning Of Islam\nWebsite: http://www.themeaningofislam.org\nBlog: http://www.blog.themeaningofislam.org\nTwitter:\nYouTube:\n\n**Note on the Arabic text**\nWhile every effort has been made for the Arabic text to be correct, it has been copied from Quran.com's text and therefore some letters might look different due to the font change.
