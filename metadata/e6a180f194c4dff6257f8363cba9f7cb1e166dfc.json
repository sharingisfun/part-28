They are even less aware of the options available for treatment of such patients. Cancer and Sexual Health fills a great need for a reference work devoted to the link between cancer and human sexuality. The volume is designed to give a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review of the sexual and reproductive consequences of cancer diagnosis and treatment. It will prove an invaluable resource for those clinicians caring for cancer patients as well as acting as a reference text for the sexual medicine clinician who may not see a large number of cancer patients.\n\n\nHardcover: 801 pages\nPublisher: Humana Press; 1st Edition. edition (April 22, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1607619156\nISBN-13: 978-1607619154","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a180f194c4dff6257f8363cba9f7cb1e166dfc","amp;dn":"Cancer+and+Sexual+Health+%28Current+Clinical+Urology%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a180f194c4dff6257f8363cba9f7cb1e166dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,161,128,241,148,196,223,246,37,127,131,99,203,169,247,203,30,22,109,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
