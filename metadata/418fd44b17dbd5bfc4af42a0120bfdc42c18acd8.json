It integrates the different sensing techniques (acoustic, electric, electromagnetic, optical, x-ray or particle beams) by unifying the underlying physical and mathematical similarities, and computational and algorithmic methods. Time-domain, spectral and multisensor methods are also covered, whilst all the necessary mathematical, statistical and linear systems tools are given in useful appendices to make the book self-contained. Featuring a logical blend of theory and applications, a wealth of color illustrations, homework problems and numerous case studies, this is suitable for use as both a course text and as a professional reference. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:418fd44b17dbd5bfc4af42a0120bfdc42c18acd8","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Subsurface+Imaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"418fd44b17dbd5bfc4af42a0120bfdc42c18acd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,143,212,75,23,219,213,191,196,175,66,160,18,11,253,196,44,24,172,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
