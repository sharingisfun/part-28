The 3rd edition was the last edition to be released in any kind of portable electronic format (e.g. CD-ROM or ebook). The latest 4th edition is, as is nowadays the case with virtually all major Oxford dictionaries/encyclopedias, only available in printed book format and as a non-downloadable web-based subscription.\n\n\nABOUT THIS HARD DISK-BASED VERSION\n----------------------------------\n\nThis hard drive-based version is a minor tweak of the original CD-ROM version. It simply unpacks the relevant files from the CD-ROM version and applies a minor Windows registry tweak on the first run in order to enable it to run from the hard drive. The compact size is simply due to the removal of various installation-related content that doesn't affect the program contents or performance in any way.\n\nOn the first run, open the executable with Administrator rihts for the registry tweak to be applied. It has been tested and confirmed to run on Windows 7 SP1 (x64) as is, with no additional manual steps or manual tweaks required.
