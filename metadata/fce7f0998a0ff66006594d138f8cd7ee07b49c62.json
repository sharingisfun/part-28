Not only is Paul diligent but also extremely attractive, a fact noticed by Kennington and his agent Mansourian, two men at the top of their chosen careers. Kennington and Paul meet again in Barcelona, where the boy is on holiday with his mother, Pamela, who is trying to get over her husband leaving her. Paul and Kennington fall in love but this has very different implications for both men. Kennington rushes back home escaping from commitment. Pamela, meanwhile, begins to recover her self-confidence but Paul is no longer a child. Back in the United States Paul learns that his musical career is not going to progress as desired; he simply is not talented enough. Paul and Pamela will learn through their living experience how to build a deeper relationship.\n\n\n01:44:37\n520x280\n29.97 FPS\n\n\nFrench hard-coded sub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fce7f0998a0ff66006594d138f8cd7ee07b49c62","amp;dn":"2002+Food+Of+Love+%28ESP-GER%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fce7f0998a0ff66006594d138f8cd7ee07b49c62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,231,240,153,138,15,246,96,6,89,77,19,143,140,215,238,7,180,156,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
