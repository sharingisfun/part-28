The two of them met when Bostek\\&amp;#039;s wife was working with Bunkley and introduced them.\nAlthough the group plays their own brand of high-energy swing music, they list their influences to be as far ranging as Louis Jordan and Black Flag. The lineup of the group is Bostek on trumpet, Bunkley on vocals, Tony Buccilli playing trombone, Duke Kingins on guitar, Shawn Scaggs on double bass, Eric Schabo wailing tenor sax, and Randy Sly on piano. Their first album was the self-released Birth of the Swerve (1998). The album was good enough to garner the interest of major labels. That meant that the follow-up, 1999\\&amp;#039;s Torch This Place, was not an independent release but rather on Atlantic. ~ Gary Hill, All Music Guide\n\nMore Info: http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/atomic_fireballs/bio.jhtml\nListen: http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/atomic_fireballs/145899/album.jhtml","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7fa519c701803df1c803a1f53c670ae3edef11","amp;dn":"The+Atomic+Fireballs+-+Torch+This+Place","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7fa519c701803df1c803a1f53c670ae3edef11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,127,165,25,199,1,128,61,241,200,3,161,245,60,103,10,227,237,239,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
