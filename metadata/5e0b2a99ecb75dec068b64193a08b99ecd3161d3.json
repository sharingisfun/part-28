It starred Peter Lorre, Otto Wernicke and Gustaf Grundgens and was considered by Lang to be his finest film. The comic series ran for four issues, beginning in 1990 and finishing up with the last issue in 1992. For his interpretation, Jon Jay Muth used a technique in which he illustrated with photographs, using watercolor techniques to give the photos a grainy, tinted look which approximated the footage of early talkies.\n\nAll four issues are included here. Thank you Fritz, thank you Jon, thank you scanners!
