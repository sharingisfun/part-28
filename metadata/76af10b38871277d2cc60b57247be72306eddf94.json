It is commonly accounted as one of the Great American Novels, and is one of the first major American novels written using Local Color Regionalism, or vernacular. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHuckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels.\n\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing Southern antebellum society that was already a quarter-century in the past by the time of publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn&lt;/a&gt; (GNU FDL)\n\n\nMore free Ebooks and Audiobooks on www.opencast.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76af10b38871277d2cc60b57247be72306eddf94","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+by+Mark+Twain+%28webseed%29+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76af10b38871277d2cc60b57247be72306eddf94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,175,16,179,136,113,39,125,44,198,11,87,36,123,231,35,6,237,223,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
