Later pressings of the albums show all of the band&amp;#039;s pseudonyms rather than their real names.\n\nDarkthrone are unique among death metal because of the absence of palm muting in any of the riffs; all of the songs are made up of fast tremolo and open notes which are far more prevalent among black metal bands.\n\n   1. &quot;Cromlech&quot;  4:11\n   2. &quot;Sunrise Over Locus Mortis&quot;  3:31\n   3. &quot;Soulside Journey&quot;  4:36\n   4. &quot;Accumulation Of Generalization&quot;  3:17\n   5. &quot;Neptune Towers&quot;  3:15\n   6. &quot;Sempiternal Sepulchrality&quot;  3:32\n   7. &quot;Grave With A View&quot;  3:27\n   8. &quot;Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia&quot;  4:00\n   9. &quot;Nor The Silent Whispers&quot;  3:18\n  10. &quot;The Watchtower&quot;  4:58\n  11. &quot;Eon&quot;  3:39\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy and packed to ISO.WV file container.
