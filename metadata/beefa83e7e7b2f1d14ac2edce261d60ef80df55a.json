'Everyone here knows him as a carpenter.'\n'Maybe he gave up, maybe he lost his courage, that doesn't matter to me,' insisted the stranger. 'But he cannot be considered to be the best archer in the country if he has abandoned his art. That's why I've been travelling all these days, in order to challenge him and put an end to a reputation he no longer deserves.'\nThe boy saw there was no point in arguing; it was best to take the man to the carpenter's shop so that he could see with his own eyes that he was mistaken.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Way of the BowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ relates the story of Tetsuya, the best archer of the country, who conveys his teachings to a boy in his village. Using the metaphor of archery the author leads us through several essential thoughts : our daily efforts and work, how to overcome difficulties, steadfastness, and courage to take risky decisions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beefa83e7e7b2f1d14ac2edce261d60ef80df55a","amp;dn":"The+Way+Of+The+Bow+by+Paulo+Coelho+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beefa83e7e7b2f1d14ac2edce261d60ef80df55a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,239,168,62,126,123,47,29,20,172,46,220,226,97,214,14,248,13,245,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
