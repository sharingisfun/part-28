Dinner at a fancy restaurant, an evening at the theater, and a romantic interlude at home should do the trick.\n\nBut a new client with an urgent case puts Griffin's plans in jeopardy. A magic talisman has been stolen, and if it isn't returned by sundown, disaster will befall not only on the thief but the innocents around him.\n\nCan Whyborne and Griffin track down and return the amulet by nightfall, or will dinner reservations become the least of their worries?\n\nNote: This story takes place between the events of Widdershins and Threshold, and is narrated from Griffin's point of view","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89595bcc78a32438670e79f5b55c95e13e4d5dd","amp;dn":"Jordan+L+Hawk+-+Whyborne+and+Griffin+Book+1.5+Eidolon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89595bcc78a32438670e79f5b55c95e13e4d5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,149,149,188,199,138,50,67,134,112,231,159,91,85,201,94,19,228,213,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
