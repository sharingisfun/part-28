En uno de sus escasos viajes a la ciudad conoce a Milagros, escapada de un reformatorio y amante de un conocido delincuente llamado El Cuqui. Angel la protege y la lleva a su casa. La animosidad de la madre hacia Milagros, asÃƒÂ­ como la atracciÃƒÂ³n que Angel siente hacia ella, unido al aspecto claustrofÃƒÂ³bico de las relaciones entre los personajes, desembocarÃƒÂ¡n en un drama. - Hermes_jmam\n\n&quot;A local Spanish governor, still impetuous and spoilt in middle age, hunts with his cronies in a forest where his former nurse runs an inn. Such insolences as seeing this figure of authority in relation to his childhood nanny underlie much of this muted and beautifully observed film. Spanish publicity for Furtivos challenged Franco's description of Spain as 'a peaceful forest' by asking 'What is rotting beneath the silence of a peaceful forest?' Thus, the family tragedy at the film's centre is related on several levels: individual, generational, political, and religious. The nurse, bitter and perhaps incestuous, is usurped by a runaway girl brought to stay by her only son. After years of repression and forced servility, she finally cracks when presented with her son's spontaneous, guilt-free relationship with the girl.

I did not encode it but am sharing it since this movie is hard to find. File was ripped from a PAL DVD, 720X576, no subs. The encoding of this file is in some ways clearer than the DVD folder which is available on file-sharing sites, and also unlike that folder, this video doesn't move up and down on the screen. There may be some cropping in a couple of scenes.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483588ec3334bfb92e643f1aca90dcf7b2ef69e9","amp;dn":"+Furtivos+%28Poachers%2C+1975%29+DVDRip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483588ec3334bfb92e643f1aca90dcf7b2ef69e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,53,136,236,51,52,191,185,46,100,63,26,202,144,220,247,178,239,105,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
