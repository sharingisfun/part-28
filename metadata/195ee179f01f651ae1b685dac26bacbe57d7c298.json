Mushroom Records became the band's label and their first album &quot;Bonk&quot; was recorded in Melbourne in 1987 and mixed in London later that year. The album went gold, then platinum in Australia with three top-twenty singles (&quot;Hungry Town&quot;, &quot;Breakaway&quot; and &quot;Big Hotel&quot;).\n\nIn the U.S. &quot;Breakaway&quot; reached #60 on the Billboard magazine top 100 pop charts and was used in the opening sequence of the movie Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure[1].\n\nThe group's song 'Money God' was well known in the United Kingdom as the theme tune for the BBC DEF II Rough Guides show with Magenta Devine, whilst many tracks from the first album &quot;Bonk&quot; were used towards the end of the Miami Vice TV series in the 1980s. The songs &quot;Hungry Town&quot; and &quot;Boy Wonder&quot; both featured in the 1988 Yahoo Serious movie Young Einstein, while their 1988 Australian Top 10 hit &quot;Breakaway&quot; recently enjoyed a revival in the dance charts with a new 2007 cover version by US House Diva Inaya Day.\n\nNotable for their dominant use of drums, harmonica and vocals, along with the absence of guitars, the band established a unique place in music. Sounding quite unlike anything else, their signature look was black waterproof aprons, similar to those worn by Blacksmiths, which gave their stage presence a distinctly industrial feel. Big Pig disbanded in 1991 after the release of their second album,You Lucky People. \n\n\n\n\n\nBonk 1988\n\n\n\nBonk is the debut studio album by Australian rock band Big Pig. It was released in March 1988 on White Label Records. The album went gold, then platinum in Australia with three top-twenty singles (&quot;Hungry Town&quot;, &quot;Breakaway&quot; and &quot;Big Hotel&quot;). The album was released in America by A&amp;M Records in 1988, and the music video for &quot;Breakaway&quot; was played on MTV. &quot;Breakaway&quot; was featured on the Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure soundtrack[1] and &quot;Hungry Town&quot; on the Young Einstein soundtrack.[2] &quot;Breakaway&quot; and &quot;Money God&quot; were used towards in the Miami Vice TV series in the 1980s.[3]\n\nIt was re-issued in 1992 by Mushroom Records.\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Iron Lung&quot; - 3:34\n2.\t&quot;Hungry Town&quot; - 3:06\n3.\t&quot;Tin Drum&quot; - 4:22\n4.\t&quot;Breakaway&quot; - 3:38\n5.\t&quot;Boy Wonder&quot; - 3:26\n6.\t&quot;Big Hotel&quot; (O.
