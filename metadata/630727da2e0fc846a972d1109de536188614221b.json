Nooteboom's writings on politics, people,\narchitecture and culture are as digressive as they are\neloquent; his innate curiosity takes him through the\nlandscapes of Heine and Goethe, steeped in Romanticism\nand mythology, and to Germany's baroque cities. With an\noutsider's objectivity he has crafted an intimate portrait\nof the country to its present day.\n\nRoads to Berlin\nBy: Cees Nooteboom\nISBN13: 9780857050274\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 714","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:630727da2e0fc846a972d1109de536188614221b","amp;dn":"Roads+to+Berlin+by+Cees+Nooteboom.+EPUB+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"630727da2e0fc846a972d1109de536188614221b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,7,39,218,46,15,200,70,169,114,209,16,157,229,54,24,134,20,34,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
