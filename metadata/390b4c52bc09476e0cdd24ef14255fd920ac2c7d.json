Harriet is energized by talented, funny Lalla, and Lalla in turn blossoms under the affection of openhearted Harriet. The girls skate together more and more. But just as Lalla's interest in skating starts to fade, Harriet's natural talent begins to emerge. Suddenly Lalla and Harriet seem headed in two very different directions.
