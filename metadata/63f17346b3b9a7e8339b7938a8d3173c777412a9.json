Recorded live in concert, the group interprets fresh renditions of hard bop oriented pieces by Sonny Clark, Hank Mobley, Big John Patton, Kenny Dorham, and Freddie Redd, in addition to one selection from Misha Mengelberg. The music swings in its own fashion and, although it tugs at the boundaries of the bop tradition, it mostly stays within its borders. Bill Frisell, operating as the entire rhythm section, is a wonder as usual. \n\nRecommended, as is the first volume News for Lulu (You Can find in my torrents).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
