I tried my luck with some of my newly made custom Perfect Declipper VST presets,\nand I got AMAZING RESULTS!!!  It went straight from DR5 to a DR12 after restoration was complete, which is \nquite excellent if you ask me.This just goes to show that Rick Rubin really should screw off, and stop producing(RUINING) more albums,\ncause all he does is make them LOUD and DISTORTED!!! But at least this isn't the worst sounding record\nin his production catalog. Death Magnetic by Metallica, on the other hand, YES, is the worst sounding album of\nall Rubin's productions! But hey, what you're all going to hear with this new remaster, is more punch, clarity,\nfar less &quot;wall of sound&quot;, and most of all, NO MORE CLIPPING!!!! :D\n\nEnjoy the new &quot;13&quot; folks!\n\nAll the best, BrickwallHater","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f2670f7d98fc8745f8dbdcd81f559e9182874a","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+13+%28BrickwallHater+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f2670f7d98fc8745f8dbdcd81f559e9182874a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,242,103,15,125,152,252,135,69,248,219,220,216,31,85,158,145,130,135,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
