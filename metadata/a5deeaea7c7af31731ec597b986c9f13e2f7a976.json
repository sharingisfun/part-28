But for some his superhuman accomplishments were beyond miraculous, too good to be true. In Lance Armstrong: Master of Spin, Bob McKeown interviews insiders who tell an astonishing story about rampant drug-use in cycling, and sketches a portrait of a mighty champion--and cheater. What drove Armstrong to such extremes, and how could he have kept his own doping secret for so long?\n\nArmstrong grew up without a father, and was raised by a hard working mother. He had a knack for sports and the mental toughness to succeed in gruelling endurance sports like the triathlon. He was a rising and ambitious star on the American cycling team, yet in his first four attempts in the Tour de France, 36th place was the best he could do--never being able to compete with the top tier of cyclists on the steep mountains.\n\nThen came his fight with cancer, and his dizzying ascent to the top of the sport, cheating every step of the way, claim his critics. He attracted legions of fans and money, and bullied and chastised all those who questioned him. How did he keep so many secrets, and keep others who knew the full story from speaking out?\n\nBob McKeown peels away the faÃƒÂ§ade, and takes a look at a remarkable man who stopped at nothing to stay at the top of the podium.\n\nOriginal broadcast date: November 23, 2012\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nLance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen0.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen1.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen2.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen3.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen4.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen5.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen6.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen7.jpg Lance-Armstrong-Master-of-Spin-Screen8.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264\n * Video Bitrate: 3699 kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Framerate: 59.940 fps\n * Audio Codec: AC3\n * Audio Bitrate: 384 kbps 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: 6\n * Audio Language: English\n * Run-Time: 00:42:01\n * Size: 1.22 GB\n * Source: 720p ATSC OTA\n * Encoded by: joeyjoejoe\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2012-2013/2012/11/lance-armstrong-master-of-spin.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2012-2013/2012/11/lance-armstrong-master-of-spin.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cyclinginvestigation.usada.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cyclinginvestigation.usada.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bradley%20Wiggins%3A%20A%20Year%20in%20Yellow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bradley%20Wiggins%3A%20A%20Year%20in%20Yellow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bradley%20Wiggins%3A%20Tour%20de%20Force&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bradley%20Wiggins%3A%20Tour%20de%20Force&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AJoeyjoejoejr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AJoeyjoejoejr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Lance_Armstrong:_Master_of_Spin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Lance_Armstrong:_Master_of_Spin&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5deeaea7c7af31731ec597b986c9f13e2f7a976","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Fifth+Estate+Lance+Armstrong+Master+Of+Spin+x264+AC3+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5deeaea7c7af31731ec597b986c9f13e2f7a976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,222,234,234,124,122,243,23,49,236,89,123,152,108,159,19,226,247,169,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
