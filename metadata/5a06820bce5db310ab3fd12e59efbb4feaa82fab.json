One that seemed like a good idea at the time but in hindsight leads to much regret and shaking of heads? One that will never, ever be re-released on CD? Well, this is the Cockney Rejects' entry to that particular hall of infamy...\n\nSynthesizers, horns, strings, bluesey guitar solos, power ballads, female backing vocals, singing really dodgy lyrics in American accents? This has it all - and really has to be heard to be believed. Really funny stuff. These aren't the skinheads you're looking for.\n\n\nSee: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Rejects-Quiet-Storm/release/2346256&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Rejects-Quiet-Storm/release/2346256&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVinyl rip at 192kbps mp3.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a06820bce5db310ab3fd12e59efbb4feaa82fab","amp;dn":"Cockney+Rejects+-+Quiet+Storm+%281984%29+oi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a06820bce5db310ab3fd12e59efbb4feaa82fab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,6,130,11,206,93,179,16,171,63,209,46,89,239,187,79,234,168,47,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
