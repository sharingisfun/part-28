Prior to their breakthrough as a soulful pop band, Pickwick explored alt-country and folk, never quite hitting their stride. Following the release of the first single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hacienda MotelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (aka Myths: Vol. 1), which won airplay on the internationally acclaimed radio station KEXP, the band found a new audience and have gone on to issue Myths: Vol. 2 (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Vol. 3 (Ã¢â‚¬Å“LimelightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). With lead Galen Disston and Grammy Award winner Kory Kruckenberg (Damien Jurado, The Maldives) on their side, Pickwick is a band to watch.
