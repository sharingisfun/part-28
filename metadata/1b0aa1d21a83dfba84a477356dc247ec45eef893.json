When they meet again years later, they fail to recognize each other and fall in love as do their wisecracking best friends (Parker Posey, Superman Returns, Best in Show and Chris Kattan, TV s Saturday Night Live ). Honest, irreverent and a whole lot of fun, Adam &amp; Steve is all about making love work whatever the odds.\n\nÃƒâ€“versatt av mig\nSwedish Hardcode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b0aa1d21a83dfba84a477356dc247ec45eef893","amp;dn":"Adam.and.Steve.2005.SWESUB.DVDRiP.AC3.SirTranslateAlot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b0aa1d21a83dfba84a477356dc247ec45eef893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,10,161,210,26,131,223,186,132,164,119,53,109,194,71,236,69,238,248,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
