For the first time in my life, I didn't need to pretend, I didn't need to be tough: I only needed to be honest. &quot;I have cerebral palsy. I walk funny and my balance is bad. I fall a lot. My hands shake, too. That means I'm not so good at carrying things. And if I drop stuff, sometimes it's hard to just bend down and get it.&quot; I waited anxiously for the interviewer's response. She smiled. &quot;It sounds like a service dog could be great for you.&quot; So began Leigh Brill's journey toward independence and confidence, all thanks to a trained companion dog named Slugger. The struggling college student and the Labrador with a &quot;a coat like sunshine&quot; and a tail that never stopped wagging became an instant team. Together, they transformed a challenge into a triumph. Together, they inspired and educated everyone they met. Now, Leigh honors her friend with the story of their life, together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5be564e48a6d5281e138770d24b432c5427e988","amp;dn":"Leigh+Brill+-+A+Dog+Named+Slugger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5be564e48a6d5281e138770d24b432c5427e988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,190,86,78,72,166,213,40,30,19,135,112,210,75,67,44,84,39,233,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
