Was Martha Leigh's new employer as romantic as his name sounded?  As she approached the sprawling mansion towering above the cliffs of Cornwall, an odd chill of apprehension overcame her.\n\nTreMellyn's young daughter, Alvean, proved as spoiled and difficult as the three governesses before Martha had discovered.  But it was the girl's father whose cool, arrogant demeanor unleashed unfamiliar sensations and turmoilÃ¢â‚¬â€even as whispers of past tragedy and present danger begin to insinuate themselves into Martha's life.\n\nPowerless against her growing desire for the enigmatic Connan, she is drawn deeper into family secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€as passion overpowers reason, sending her head and heart spinning.  But though evil lurks in the shadows, so does loveÃ¢â‚¬â€and the freedom to find a golden promise foreverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nReview\n=================\n\nOriginally published nearly 40 years ago, this Gothic classic has been frightening, romancing, and winning fans ever since. Part Jane Eyre, part Rebecca and all good, clean, campy fun, Mistress of Mellyn will keep you tearing through the pages, and looking for copies to lend out to friends.\n\nOur heroine Martha Leigh is a prim and freshly minted governess who has been hired by the remote and demanding Connan TreMellyn to care for his daughter Alvean. As the departure of the three prior governesses suggests, Alvean is a difficult charge, though understandably so since the recent death of her mother, Alice. As Martha tries to connect with Alvean, she researches the history of Mellyn, and discovers hidden family secrets that still haunt the present. Now familiar with Alvean, she feels herself falling for Connan. Though the desire between Martha and Connan grows, Alice's tragic death continues to haunt them both and endanger any future they may have.\n\nA delightful combination of highbrow writing and lowbrow sentiments, Mistress of Mellyn is a guilt-free treat you can indulge in. The romance, suspense, and mystery tromp across the pages with predictable frequency, and there are enough dark looks and dark corridors for any Gothic fan. Ã¢â‚¬â€ Nancy R.E. O'Brien\n\nOther Reviews\n=============\n\n&quot;Gothic romance thriller which out-thrills and out-gothics most.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Evening Standard\n&quot;For a good escapist read Victoria Holt never disappoints.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Netta Martin, Annabel\n&quot;Women of all ages with a vestige of romance in their make-up will devour this in a bite!&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Everywoman\n&quot;It is superb storytelling!
