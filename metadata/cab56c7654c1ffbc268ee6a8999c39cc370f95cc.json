Crowell Company | 1968 | ISBN: N/A | English | 354 pages | PDF | 58.6 MB\r\n\r\nThis is the third revised edition by Gosta Saflund of a work which originally appeared in Stockholm in 1932. Besides being considerably revised and updated, it is the first English translation, and features 192 photographs and figures. The late Ernst Kjellberg was lecturer at Stockholm University; Gosta Saflund is professor of classical archaeology at the same university and has published several volumes on ancient art. They give a comprehensive survey commencing with the Bronze Age in Crete and continuing to Constantinople. Their account also covers Etruscan art and Early Byzantine art. Plans and drawings and a glossary complement the detailed and legible text. Happily, the periods under discussion are treated in terms of artistic aims, cultural influences, and historical events. Teachers, interested laymen, and students will welcome this convenient text as a basis for further studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cab56c7654c1ffbc268ee6a8999c39cc370f95cc","amp;dn":"Greek+and+Roman+Art%2C+3000+BC+to+AD+550+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cab56c7654c1ffbc268ee6a8999c39cc370f95cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,181,108,118,84,193,255,188,38,142,230,168,153,156,57,204,55,15,149,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
