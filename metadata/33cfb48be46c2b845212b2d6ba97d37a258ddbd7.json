M.  Gelfond also sometimes written as\n Gelfand. \n\nIsrael Gelfand is an highly accomplished mathematician who is also a\n pedagogue, and has written several texts at elementary level apart\n from numerous higher level texts. They include  Algebra,\n Trigonometry, Functions and Graphs, Combinatorics, Method of\n Coordinates. \n\nThe book is devoted to one of the most interesting branches of\nnumber theory, the solution of equations in integers. The solution\nin integers of algebraic equations in more than one unknown with\nintegral coefficients is a most difficult problem in the theory of\nnumbers. The theoretical importance of equations with integral\ncoefficients is quite great as they are closely connected with many\nproblems of number theory. Moreover, these equations are\nsometimes encountered in physics and so they are also\nimportant in practice. The elements of the theory of equations with\nintegral coefficients as presented in this book are suitable for\nbroadening the mathematical outlook of high-school students and\nstudents of pedagogical institutes. Some of the main results in the\ntheory of the solution of equations in integers have been given and\nproofs of the theorems involved are supplied when they are\nsufficiently simple.\n\n\n The book was translated the Russian by O. B. Sheinin and was first published by Mir in 1981.\n\n  PDF | Cover | Bookmarks | OCR | 3.2 MB | 60 pp | 600 dpi\n\n  \n  Released on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n\nContents\nPreface 7\nIntroduction 7\n1.
