Based on the true story, the film follows the investigators path through several leads before introducing the Strangler as a character. It is seen almost exclusively from the point of view of the investigators who have very few clues to build a case upon. \n\nStarring: Tony Curtis, Henry Fonda and George Kennedy\nDirector: Richard Fleischer\n\n\nVideo: MPEG2PAL 16:9 720x576\n\nAudio: English, French, Derman, Italian and Spanish Dolby AC-3/2\n\nSubs: Castellano, Dansk, Deutsch, Greek, Francais, Italiano,\n      Nederlands, Norsk, Suomi, Svenska\n      English for the hearing impaired\n\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062755/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062755/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b938b91acca0d1af1decc4deac0066961030cc","amp;dn":"The+Boston+Strangler+%28Curtis%2C+Fonda%29+%5B1968%5D+5+audio+%2B+multisub++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b938b91acca0d1af1decc4deac0066961030cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,185,56,185,26,204,160,209,175,29,236,196,222,172,0,102,150,16,48,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
