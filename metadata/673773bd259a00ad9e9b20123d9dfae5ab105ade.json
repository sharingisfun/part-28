BerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;My Tambourine&quot;, released by Mercury on the album Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrom St. Louie To FriscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 1968, is an early version of his later hit, only with less-risque lyrics. The original studio version of &quot;My Ding-A-Ling&quot; was released on the Chess album Ã¢â‚¬ËœBack HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 1970.\n\nThe version of &quot;My Ding-A-Ling&quot; that actually went to number one happened to be recorded in Coventry, England in 1972, where Chuck Berry was part of the famous Lanchester Arts Festival bill. Slade were on earlier, Pink Floyd were on later. \n \nBerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance would later be released as Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe London Chuck Berry SessionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\n\nChuck Berry\n\nMy Ding-A-Ling \n\n\nCD / 2015 / Compilation / VBR-V0 &amp; 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.\tChuck Berry - My Ding-A-Ling (Original Studio Version 1970)\n\n2.\tChuck Berry - My Ding-A-Ling (Live Single Edit 1972)\n\n3.\tChuck Berry - LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Boogie (Single B-Side 1972)\n\n4.\tChuck Berry - My Ding-A-Ling (Full Live Version 1972)\n\n5.\tChuck Berry - Johnny B.
