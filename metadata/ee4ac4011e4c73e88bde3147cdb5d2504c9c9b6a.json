It was released on July 10, 2007, and was later followed by a DVD release with extra tracks in September, 2007. The album features two new songs, some old Black Crowes songs, as well as some covers. The album is a compilation from several shows at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles, California recorded during the 2006 Brothers of a Feather tour. The show features an intimate duet performance by the Robinson brothers, with most of the songs featuring only one or two guitars and vocals, with occasional accompaniment from Mona Lisa Young and Charity White, the Black Crowes' backing vocals duo, as well as a guest appearance by Tenor Saxophonist Dave Ellis of The Left Coast Horns.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Horsehead&quot;\n    &quot;Cursed Diamond&quot;\n    &quot;Over The Hill&quot; (John Martyn cover)\n    &quot;Magic Rooster Blues&quot; (new Black Crowes song)\n    &quot;My Heart's Killing Me&quot;\n    &quot;Forgiven Song&quot; (Rich Robinson solo song)\n    &quot;Someday Past The Sunset&quot; (previously unreleased Chris Robinson solo song)\n    &quot;Roll Um Easy&quot; (Little Feat cover)\n    &quot;Cold Boy Smile&quot; (new Black Crowes song)\n    &quot;Driving Wheel&quot; (David Wiffen cover, as popularized by Tom Rush)[2]\n    &quot;Leave It Alone&quot; (Rich Robinson solo Song)\n    &quot;Polly&quot; (Gene Clark cover)\n    &quot;Darling Of The Underground Press&quot;\n    &quot;Thorn In My Pride&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4ac4011e4c73e88bde3147cdb5d2504c9c9b6a","amp;dn":"Chris+and+Rich+Robinson+-+Brothers+Of+A+Feather%3A+Live+At+The+Rox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4ac4011e4c73e88bde3147cdb5d2504c9c9b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,74,196,1,30,76,115,232,139,222,49,71,205,181,210,80,76,156,155,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
