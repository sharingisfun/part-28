These, of course, offer a good idea of the general &quot;shape of things,&quot; but not exactly how ordinary folks adapted what their betters wore. Worrell portrays men, women, and children, militias and Regulars, working people and the leisure class, virtually side by side, with a clear, nicely detailed pen sketch and extensive descriptive paragraph for each costume. This book and its companion, Early American Costume, must absolutely be on the shelf of everyone who has occasion to research historic American clothing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86144a6ef64e045439210455c9a418ededc08e85","amp;dn":"American+Costume%2C+1840-1920+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86144a6ef64e045439210455c9a418ededc08e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,20,74,110,246,78,4,84,57,33,4,85,201,164,24,237,237,192,142,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
