He is often called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe King Of Ragtime GuitarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. There is only one photograph of him in existence.\n\nBlind Blake recorded about 80 tracks for Paramount Records in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He was one of the most accomplished guitarists of his genre with a surprisingly diverse range of material. His complex and intricate fingerpicking has inspired Reverend Gary Davis, Jorma Kaukonen, Ry Cooder, Ralph Mctell and many others. He is most known for his distinct guitar sound that was comparable in sound and style to a ragtime piano.\n\nVery little is known about his life. His birthplace was listed as Jacksonville, Florida by Paramount Records but even that is in dispute. Nothing is known of his death. Even his name is not certain. During recordings he was asked about his real name and he answered that his name was Blind Arthur Blake which is also listed on some of the song credits, strengthening his case on his real name, although there is a suggestion that his real name was Arthur Phelps.\n\nHis first recordings were made in 1926 and his records sold well. His first solo record was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEarly Morning BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWest Coast BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the B-side. Both are considered excellent examples of his style. Blake made his last recordings in 1932, the end of his career aided by ParamountÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bankruptcy. It is often said that the later recordings have much less sparkle and, allegedly, Blind Blake was drinking heavily in his later years. It is likely that this led to his early death.
