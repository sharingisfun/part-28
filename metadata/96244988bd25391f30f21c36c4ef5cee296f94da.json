This is NOT a good copy. The quality is fine, but the file is slightly corrupted. There are a few moments when the video will freeze or jump by a second.\n\nHowever, the only torrent I've been able to find for this film is composed of a bunch of rars and not fully seeded. I downloaded the 96% of that torrent I could, and reconstructed and extracted the rars to get this. \n\nDownload it if you want, given those caveats. If you do download, please seed. And if you find a better torrent, PLEASE leave a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96244988bd25391f30f21c36c4ef5cee296f94da","amp;dn":"The+Rise+and+Rise+of+Michael+Rimmer.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96244988bd25391f30f21c36c4ef5cee296f94da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,36,73,136,189,37,57,31,48,242,28,54,196,239,92,238,41,111,148,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
