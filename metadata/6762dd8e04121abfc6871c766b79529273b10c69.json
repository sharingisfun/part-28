Featuring cuts from Nick Holder, DJ Spen, Aaron-\nCarl, David Alvarado, Dano and Halo Varga, nite:life 01\ncaptures the Beloved main man in dance-floor mode, twisting\nand snaking the deep rhythms with vocals, deep keys and\ntribal undertones.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nrkmusic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nrkmusic.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDownloaded from the label's web site via its official blog.\nCue sheet put together with info retrieved from web stores\nand whatnot.\n\nThere are several minor clicks in the album and some\nforeground noise at 23:05. Since we didn't reencode\nanything, I'd say it was probably the ripper's fault.\n__________________________________________________\n\nncore releases\n38+: http://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo\n1-37: http://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6762dd8e04121abfc6871c766b79529273b10c69","amp;dn":"VA-Nite_Life_Volume_01_%28Mixed_By_Jon_Marsh%29-Web-2000-ncore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6762dd8e04121abfc6871c766b79529273b10c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,98,221,142,4,18,26,191,198,135,28,118,107,121,82,146,115,177,12,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
