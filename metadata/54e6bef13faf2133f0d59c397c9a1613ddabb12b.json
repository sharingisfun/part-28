Digital Processing done with\nPolderbits&amp;#039; Sound Recorder and Editor (minor crackle removal and\na little adjustment on EQ).\n\nIMO this is Spiral&amp;#039;s best release, and sums up how bad the CJA\nwas for rave culture. More breakbeat and better paced than\nthe later releases, this has does have liberal use of &amp;#039;bad&amp;#039;\nlanguage in the first two tracks ;)\n\nSeed and Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e6bef13faf2133f0d59c397c9a1613ddabb12b","amp;dn":"Spiral+Tribe+-+Breach+The+Peace+EP+%28vinyl+rip+192Kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e6bef13faf2133f0d59c397c9a1613ddabb12b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,230,190,241,63,175,33,51,240,213,156,57,124,154,22,19,221,171,177,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
