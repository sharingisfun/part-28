Book Covers included.\n\n1) The Fall of Paris  : The Siege and the Commune 1870-71.\n2) The Price of Glory : Verdun 1916.\n3) To Lose a Battle   : France 1940.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe Fall of Paris: The Siege and the Commune 1870-71 \n----------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1870, Paris was the center of Europe, the font of culture, fashion, and invention. Ten months later Paris had been broken by a long Prussian siege, its starving citizens reduced to eating dogs, cats, and rats, and France had been forced to accept the humiliating surrender terms dictated by the Iron Chancellor Bismarck. To many, the fall of Paris seemed to be the fall of civilization itself. Alistair Horne's history of the Siege and its aftermath is a tour de force of military and social history, rendered with the sweep and color of a great novel.\n\nThe collapse of France in 1870 had an overwhelming impact - on Paris, on France and on the rest of the world. People everywhere saw Paris as the center of Europe and the hub of culture, fashion and invention. Suddenly France, not least to the disbelief of her own citizens, was gripped in the vice of the Iron ChancellorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armies and forced to surrender on humiliating terms. In this brilliant study of the Siege and its aftermath, Alistair Horne evokes the high drama of those ten fantastic months and the spiritual agony which Paris and the Parisians suffered.\n\n\nThe Fall of Paris is the first part of the trilogy including To Lose a Battle and The Price of Glory.\n\nPrint Length: 473 pages\nPenguin, 2007\n\n\n-------------------------------\nThe Price of Glory: Verdun 1916\n-------------------------------\n\nThe battle of Verdun lasted ten months. It was a battle in which at least 700,000 men fell, along a front of fifteen miles. Its aim was less to defeat \nthe enemy than bleed him to death and a battleground whose once fertile terrain is even now a haunted wilderness. Alistair Horne's classic work, continuously in print for over fifty years, is a profoundly moving, sympathetic study of the battle and the men who fought there. It shows that Verdun is a key to understanding the First World War to the minds of those who waged it, the traditions that bound them and the world that gave them the opportunity.\n\nPrint Length: 400 pages\nPenguin, 2007\n\n-----------------------------\nTo Lose a Battle: France 1940 \n-----------------------------\n\nDuring six weeks in 1940, Hitler's blitzkrieg shattered the redoubtable Maginot Line and, shortly thereafter, the French army. No historian has written a more definitive chronicle of that disaster than Alistair Horne, or one so emotionally gripping. Moving with cinematic swiftness from the battlefield to the Reichstag and the Palais de l'Ãƒâ€°lysÃƒÂ©e, To Lose a Battle overspills the confines of traditional military history to become a portrait of the French national soul in its darkest night.\n\nPrint Length: 740 pages\nPenguin, 2007.\n\n\n======\nAuthor\n======\n\nOne of Britain's greatest historians, Sir Alistair Horne, CBE, is the author of several famous books on French history as well as a two-volume life of Harold Macmillan. \n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60594333d182d586bead3837726ed2c5b54c2395","amp;dn":"Alistair+Horne+-+Paris+Trilogy+%28Penguin+History%29+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60594333d182d586bead3837726ed2c5b54c2395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,89,67,51,209,130,213,134,190,173,56,55,114,110,210,197,181,76,35,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
