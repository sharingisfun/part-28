I am learning assembly from reading various tutorials online, reading books, and ask questions in newsgroups and IRC. There are a lot of assembly programming tutorials online, but this tutorial will focus on Windows programming in x86 assembly. Knowledge of higher level programming languages and basic knowledge of computer architecture is assumed.
