This lighter-than-air comedy puts playboy writer Cary Grant in company with 17-year-old schoolgirl Shirley Temple, although he&amp;#039;s more interested in older sister Myrna Loy. (She&amp;#039;s as sober as a judge, and indeed is one.) The OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®- winning script by future bestselling novelist Sidney Sheldon boasts fun &amp;#039;40s slang, but the main draw is Grant&amp;#039;s willingness to play the fool. His gift for slapstick shines when his aging bachelor decides to act like an inane teenager in an effort to burst Shirley&amp;#039;s fanciful image of him. As usual, Grant seems to conspire with the audience (watch his double takes in the background) in making a somewhat standard movie into a giddy experience. Toss in deadpan Rudy Vallee as a sappy third wheel, and you&amp;#039;ve got a near-classic.\n\n\nSummary from Amazon.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7a748f2a72374180248a9e3dd1053cfafbf40c","amp;dn":"The+Bachelor+and+the+Bobby-Soxer+%281947%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7a748f2a72374180248a9e3dd1053cfafbf40c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,122,116,143,42,114,55,65,128,36,138,158,61,209,5,60,250,251,244,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
