In 1985 they (together with Vadim's younger brother Gleb Samoylov, who was born in Asbest, August 4, 1970) created a music band named &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¤ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â£Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“&quot; (which literally stands for: vocal-instrumental ensemble of Radioengineering faculty of Ural Polytechnical Institute). The original band comprises:\nÃƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â± Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² (Gleb Samoylov) -- vocals, guitar, bass, lyrics, adaptation, keyboard\nÃƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² (Vadim Samoylov) -- vocals, guitar, bass, lyrics, adaptation, keyboard\nÃƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² (Andrey Kotov) -- drums, percussion\nÃƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² (Aleksandr Kozlov) -- keyboard, composer/lyrics (now deceased)\n\nThey released several tape albums: &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ (If)&quot;, &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ (Light)&quot;, and others. In the same year they changed the name of the band to &quot;Agata Kristi,&quot; the way Agatha Christie's name is pronounced in Russian. The name was chosen allegedly as best reflecting the band's sound style, a mysterious, eccentric, and at times sadistically spooky mix of glam, goth rock, and techno-like electronics.\n\nThe official birthday of &quot;Agata Kristi&quot; is February 20, 1988, the day of their first concert and the release of the first official album &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¤Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡&quot; (Second Front). In 1988-1989 &quot;Agata Kristi&quot; played at several rock festivals and was noticed. Still, two more albums to follow -- &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã…Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™&quot; (Craft and Love) and &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½&quot; (Decadence) -- seemed overly theatrical and pompous. There were also some internal tensions in the band. Petr Mai left and was replaced by Andrey Kotov (born in Sverdlovsk, April 3, 1963).\n\nIn 1993 the band released a much more focused and balanced album &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°&quot; (Shameful Star), which marked a shift from the guitar-driven glam rock of the previous albums to synth-based post-punk with a more subdued vocal delivery. The next album &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼&quot; (Opium) enjoyed considerable success. &quot;Agata Kristi&quot; quickly became a popular act. Two songs from &quot;Opium&quot; -- &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°&quot; (Fairy Taiga) and &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾&quot; (Opium for Nobody) became hits. The next albums - &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â£Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½&quot; (Hurricane) and &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â§Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°&quot; (Miracles) -- were gloomy, even depressive, and loaded with electronics, a move which was not welcomed by many of the band's fans. A 2000 &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã…â€œÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¾?&quot; (a word-play derived from Mein Kampf and the Russian word &quot;Kaif&quot;, meaning 'bliss') featured sound no less gloomy and bleak than its predecessors, but received critical praise because of its unorthodox composition and song structures. In 2001 the founding keyboardist Alexander Kozlov died, which is said to be the reason for prolonged creative stagnation. It was only in 2004 that the Samoylovs released the next album: &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â§Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™ 1&quot; (Thriller Part 1). Despite a significant stylistic deviation from the band's trademark murky electronic sound, this lean, heavier, hard rock-infused album was generally well received by both listeners and critics. Several songs from this album made to the top of charts in Russia.\n\nWhile being less prolific in the 2000's, &quot;Agata Kristi&quot; have proved to be quite long-lasting a project. Over their history, the band explored a variety of styles, from the synth-pop of Depeche Mode and Freddie Mercury's extravaganza to the gloomy post-punk of The Cure and The Damned. Unlike the majority of the Russian rock scene, which historically adhered to the guitar-driven rock, &quot;Agata Kristi&quot; embraced a hefty share of synthesizer rhythms and drums, which, together with the characteristic vocals switching from suggestive whisper to hysterical shrieks, makes their style easily recognizable. &quot;Agata Kristi&quot; won the Grand-Prix of the festival of young European bands &quot;Open du Rock&quot; (France, 1991), &quot;World Music Award&quot; as the most popular Russian music band (Monte-Carlo, 1997), and four national &quot;Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ (Ovation)&quot; prizes.\n\nDiscography\n\nOriginal title\nTransliterated Title\nTranslation\nYear of release\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ \nVtoroy front\nSecond Front\n1988\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã…Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™\nKovarstvo i lyubov'\nCruelty and Love\n1989\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½\nDekadans\nDecadence\n1991\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã…Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°\nPozornaya zvezda\nShameful Star \n1993\n\nOpium \nOpium \nOpium \n1995\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â£Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½\nUragan\nHurricane\n1996\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â° Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½\nDva korablya\nTwo Ships\n1998\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â§Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°\nChudesa\nMiracles\n1998\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã…â€œÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¾?\nMein Kaif?\nMy Bliss?
