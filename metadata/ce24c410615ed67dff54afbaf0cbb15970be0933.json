But then they decided to change it to UROK (You are okay) for a more positive sound. Fans at shows then started writing UROK on pizza boxes and showing them off to the band as they were playing thinking that UROK meant &quot;You Rock.&quot; (They may have had the name wrong, but at least they had the right idea!) When record companies didn't take the band seriously, they decided it would be in their best interest to change their name. A reviewer had once said their music sounded like a &quot;Psychedelic Haze.&quot; So eventually the band changed their name to &quot;The Hazies.&quot;\n\nThe Hazies later then got signed to EMI Records, and released &quot;Vinnie Smokin' in the Big Room&quot; in 1996. The song &quot;Skin &amp; Bones&quot; reached number 7 and &quot;Trip Free Life&quot; reached number 11 on rock radio formats. Unfortunately, EMI Records fell through and the band was left hanging for a year or so. In 1997, they had a single on the &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot; Soundtrack starring Chris Farley called &quot;Turning Japanese.\nFirst of all, let me say that this CD never really got the recognition it deserves. It is a great slab of hard rock, people! You all know the single, &quot;Skin &amp; Bones&quot;, which was way ahead of its' time (It was written in 1992, before all of the other stuff that sounded like it came out around '96 or '97), but there's alot more to them than that. There are good party songs like &quot;Dancin' At Seven&quot; and &quot;#1 Slave&quot;, beautifully crafted songs like &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Effedrin&quot;, and some just plain rockin' stuff like &quot;Trip Free Life&quot; and &quot;I'm The One&quot;. The rest of it aint too bad either \nb]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce24c410615ed67dff54afbaf0cbb15970be0933","amp;dn":"The+Hazies+-+Vinnie+Smokin%27+In+The+Big+Room+%5B1996%5D%5BEAC.CUE.LOG%2CF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce24c410615ed67dff54afbaf0cbb15970be0933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,36,196,16,97,94,214,125,255,84,175,186,240,203,177,89,112,190,9,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
