Sven Co-op was released on January 19, 1999 - before Valve's Team Fortress Classic - and is therefore the oldest Half-Life mod in existence that is still in development. It has since grown to become a full blown mod, with a full team, and one of the most played games on Steam as of September 18, 2006, excluding the official games by Valve.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, have fun, and seed please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e80d81943ee6fc55a0d01acec6596318f2c9f8d","amp;dn":"Sven+Co-op+v4.5+%5BHL1+Mod%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e80d81943ee6fc55a0d01acec6596318f2c9f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,128,216,25,67,238,111,197,90,13,1,172,236,101,150,49,143,44,159,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
