He has said on the networking website Myspace that &quot;The idea back then was to do a thing called Project 56 which was 56 tracks for people with short attention spans. Instead of waiting years to finally throw it together, I figured I'd just toss it to everyone.&quot;[1] This album includes some tracks (be it or not in variant form) and elements that appear on the album Get Scraped.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81061205ebc7a2137660de66914f3327751f4fee","amp;dn":"deadmau5+Project+56+%282008%29+%28Re-Upload+2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81061205ebc7a2137660de66914f3327751f4fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,6,18,5,235,199,162,19,118,96,222,102,145,79,51,39,117,31,79,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
