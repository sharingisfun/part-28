Through a lifetime of research, he has developed key scientific concepts in sport that have not only redefined the way elite athletes and teams approach their professions, but challenged conventional global thinking in these areas. In this new and updated edition of Challenging Beliefs, Noakes shares his views on everything from the myths perpetuated by the sports-drink industry to the prevalence of banned substances, the need to make rugby a safer sport and the benefits of a high-protein, low-carb diet. The teams and athletes with whom Noakes has worked make fascinating backdrops to these topics, highlighting the importance of science in sport in human terms. In providing an intimate look at the golden threads running through NoakesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and career, this remarkable book reveals the landmark theories and principles generated by one of the greatest minds in the history of sports science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e30e5fe74ad35a1e59b6444f2bc1d0b68f6b6f0","amp;dn":"Challenging+Beliefs+By+Noakes+and+Vlismas+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e30e5fe74ad35a1e59b6444f2bc1d0b68f6b6f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,48,229,254,116,173,53,161,229,155,100,68,242,188,29,11,104,246,182,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
