Whilst working on the project we had the feeling that there is so much more great and influential minimal music from way before the techno thing started.\n\nSo we were very excited to combine the music from the electronic pioneers, with the tracks from the minimal techno godfathers in a very modern way. In Minimal Music there is so much (space) in between the sounds and the space that gives you a lot of opportunities for an own interpretation.\n\nThe Grandfather Paradox is a scientific theory about time travelling and was first described by the science fiction writer Rene Barjavel in his book - Le Voyageur Imprudent. We took suggestions out of that because we felt like we are travelling back in time and manipulating the old music with modern knowledge. The fact that we did all this with the deserved respect to the originals makes us quite sure that the results are bringing something new and interesting to the old tracks and transport the past into the here and now.\n\n- Henrik Schwarz, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡me &amp; Dixon\n\n\nOriginally released 2009-02-23 \n\nCD1: Mixed\n01.
