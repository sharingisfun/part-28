(Some copies have been reported to list disc one as disc two, and vice\nversa.) Track 20 is about &quot;voodo mar-juh-rene underpants&quot; and track 24 about &quot;the Women&amp;#039;s Movement&quot; - in a discussion on alt.fan.frank-zappa\nin March 2000 about &quot;the dumbest or most embarassing thing Zappa said on stage&quot;, this talk on &quot;the Women&amp;#039;s Movement&quot; was one of two things\nthat came up. JWB describes it like this:\n\nBefore the encore, somebody passes a note onstage. It has a bunch of fan-esque compliments and then it says something like &quot;the only\nthing about you that sucks is your attitude towards women&quot; ... and then it says something about the Raggedy Ann doll and how he\nshould make it do some things to men who are just as dumb as the women he makes fun of, rather than sexual things. \n\nThen Zappa replies out of the blue, in a condescending voice, with something like, &quot;Let me tell you about women&amp;#039;s movements. The\nonly good women&amp;#039;s movement is the one where I&amp;#039;m inside of them and they&amp;#039;re holding onto the bedpost and their eyes are rolled up in\nthe back of their head. What do you think about that?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7a80124c4ee7752557a345c96f9bd9df9989819","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+Kreega+Bondola","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7a80124c4ee7752557a345c96f9bd9df9989819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,168,1,36,196,238,119,82,85,122,52,92,150,249,189,157,249,152,152,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
