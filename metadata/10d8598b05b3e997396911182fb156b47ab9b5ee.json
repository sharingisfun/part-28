The original tape was made from the back row of the theatre and was recorded very low due to the extreme dynamic range of this group. Sometime in the late 80's I did a dub with some compression/noise reduction and EQ and applied some fades. Thats the tape this seed is made from. The master tape is MIA.\n\nThe sound overall is good, not great, but this is one AMAZING concert, Zorn's live performances of this material were few and far between, and AFAIK this is the only show that used such a large ensemble. And with 5 of the most distinctive axe manglers on the planet in one group.....lets just say that if you could only download one Zorn torrent, this would be a prime candidate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d8598b05b3e997396911182fb156b47ab9b5ee","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+plays+Ennio+Morricone+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d8598b05b3e997396911182fb156b47ab9b5ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,216,89,139,5,179,233,151,57,105,17,24,47,177,86,180,122,185,181,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
