It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e73824d06199296cefaad16f88d00ce957f5e88","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e73824d06199296cefaad16f88d00ce957f5e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,115,130,77,6,25,146,150,206,250,173,22,248,141,0,206,149,127,94,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
