Once you have login to Vista after the installation have finished, extract VistaLoader.zip to &quot;C:VistaLoader&quot; \n    \n3.  Run command prompt with administrator access. (Go to start menu and type command prompt in the search bar, command prompt should show up, just right click command prompt and click run as administrator) \n\n4.  Once you are in command prompt (DOS), you should see C:WindowsSystem32&gt; just type &quot;CD&quot; without quote and click enter, then type &quot;CDVistaLoader&quot; without quote and click enter.\n\n5.  You should read C:VistaLoader&gt; Once you see this just type &quot;install.cmd [oem]&quot; without quote and click enter. *replace [oem] with Asus, Hp, Acer, Lenovo, Sony or Dell.\n    VERY IMPORTANT!!!! You MUST replace [oem] with the manufacturer that provided the serial you use for installing Vista SP1. \n    (eg. If you installed Vista SP1 using the serial from Dell, just type &quot;install.cmd dell&quot; without quote and click enter.)\n\n6.  Reboot your system and you are activated!!\n\n\n  \n\nAsus\n~~~~\nUltimate: 6f2d7-2pcg6-yqqtb-fwk9v-932cc\nBusiness: 72pfd-bcbk8-r7x4h-6f2xj-vvmp9\nHome premium: bh626-xt3fk-mjkjh-6gqt2-qxqmf\nHome premium: 8xpm9-7f9hd-4jjqp-tp64y-rpffv\nHome basic: 2wp98-khth2-kc7kg-4yr37-h8phc\nHome basic: 762hw-qd98x-tqvxj-8rkrq-rjc9v\n\nAcer\n~~~~\nHome premium: 2tybw-xkcqm-xy9x3-jdxyp-6cj97\n\nHp\n~~\nUltimate: 6f2d7-2pcg6-yqqtb-fwk9v-932cc\nHome premium: 2r6wf-kyf88-27hyq-xtkw2-wqd8q\nHome premium: gp3fq-jb647-7cw8f-h646b-7pmgf\n\n\nLenovo\n~~~~~~\nHome premium: 34bkk-qk76y-wwr7c-qf2m7-2tb37\n\n\nDell\n~~~~~~\nHome premium : 4gptt-6ryc4-f4gjk-kg77h-b9hd2\nBusiness : 368y7-49ymq-vrcty-3v3rh-wrmg7\nUltimate : 2qbp3-289mf-9364x-37xgx-24w6p\n\n\n\nThe full credit for this activator goes to the unknown chinese hackers who&amp;#039;ve made this crack.
