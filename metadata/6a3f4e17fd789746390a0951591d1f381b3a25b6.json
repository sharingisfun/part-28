When you're Tim Wyman, sometimes there are three.\n\nTim hoped moving to Texas would mean a new beginning, a chance to spread his wings, but he soon finds himself falling into the same tired patterns. Until he meets recklessly brave Benjamin Bentley. Suddenly a whole new world opens up to Tim--love, sex, warmth... home. Certain that society won't understand what he and Ben have together, Tim struggles to protect their relationship, even if it means twisting the truth. As his lies slowly push Ben away, Tim learns that the greatest enemy can come from within. Buried beneath a decade of deceptions, Tim must claw his way to the surface in the hopes of learning to fly.\n\nSomething Like Winter, the companion novel to Something Like Summer, tells the story from Tim Wyman's perspective, revealing new private moments and personal journeys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a3f4e17fd789746390a0951591d1f381b3a25b6","amp;dn":"Something+Like+Winter+-+Jay+Bell+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a3f4e17fd789746390a0951591d1f381b3a25b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,63,78,23,253,120,151,70,57,10,9,81,89,29,31,56,27,58,37,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
