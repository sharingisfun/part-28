She would never know that Watson and Crick had seen a crucial piece of her data without her permission. This was an X-ray image, &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Photo 51,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; that proved to be a vital clue in their decoding of the double helix.\n\n50 years later, NOVA investigates the shocking truth behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries and presents a moving portrait of a brilliant woman in an era of male-dominated science. Sadly, Franklin never lived to see her vital role in the discovery vindicated. While Watson and Crick went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1962, Franklin died in 1958, at 37, from ovarian cancer; and the Nobel is not awarded posthumously.\n\nHear the inside story from Maurice Wilkins, the colleague who showed her crucial x-ray to Watson; Raymond Gosling, Franklin?s Ph.D. student with whom she made Photo 51; and Nobel Prize winner Sir Aaron Klug, Franklin?s last collaborator, who shows new evidence of just how close Franklin came to making the vital double helix discovery herself.\n\n\nReviews__________________________________\n\n&quot;. . . it&amp;#039;s a fascinating ride through the science fom which all modern medical miracles continue to flow.&quot; - The Wall Street Journal\n\n&quot;This NOVA program, narrated by Sigourney Weaver, is one of those stories that transcend the world of science.&quot; - The Globe and Mail\n\n?This absorbing NOVA documentary finally gives Rosalind Franklin her due, combining interviews with fellow researchers, friends, biographer Brenda Maddox, and current molecular scientists, with still photos of Franklin, an intense, attractive young woman dedicated to working for ?the improvement of mankind? . . .
