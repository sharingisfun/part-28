The game has spawned several sequels, as part of the Alone in the Dark series, and was one of the first survival horror games, after the 1989 Capcom game, Sweet Home. Alone in the Dark set the standard for later survival horror games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill. X-Play rated the game as the tenth scariest game of all time.[1]\n\nThis game is known to take place in the same continuity as Infogrames's slightly later game Shadow of the Comet, as a book located in the game makes explicit reference to elements of Shadow of the Comet's backstory.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51c63a4e6209da1cb554445408716a1a931ddc4","amp;dn":"Alone+in+The+Dark+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51c63a4e6209da1cb554445408716a1a931ddc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,28,99,164,230,32,157,161,203,85,68,69,64,135,22,161,169,49,221,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
