Kyle Domer (aka Vegan Vegrant) says: &quot;This is a party on paper! These recipes take the hassle out of guilt-free dessert decadence.&quot; Reginald Beck (Fearless Bread) states: &quot;It lives up to its title by providing REAL dessert classics with a vegan attitude. Maltese and Wright set the standard for vegan dessert recipes, from their heavenly spice cake to their decadent peanut butter SÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mores cheesecake.&quot; Victor J. Banis (The Pot Thickens) adds: &quot;These two published authors prove themselves as adept with pots as they are with plots. Here, they conjure my favorite courseÃ¢â‚¬â€dessertÃ¢â‚¬â€with mouth-watering vegan panache.&quot; Well-known author A.B. Gayle notes: &quot;GET-REAL VEGAN DESSERTS isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just for vegans but for friends and relatives of vegans who hesitate to invite, not knowing what to feed. Apart from its great recipes, the book provides invaluable information on acceptable ingredients and how to access them.&quot; Cookbook writer Bonnie Clark says: &quot;I never dreamed there could be such a variety of decadent and delicious vegan desserts as offered up by Wright and Maltese by way of these mouth-watering recipes that so shamelessly seduce even a die-hard meat-eater like me!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5703ad4da5fedfe5e160ffb10f11553129653b1","amp;dn":"Get-Real+Vegan+Desserts%2C+Vegan+Recipes+For+The+Rest+Of+Us+-+Chri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5703ad4da5fedfe5e160ffb10f11553129653b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,112,58,212,218,95,237,254,94,22,15,251,16,241,21,83,18,150,83,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
