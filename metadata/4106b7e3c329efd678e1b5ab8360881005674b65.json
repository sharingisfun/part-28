Many of the threatened shortcomings of earlier Kurosawa films here reach fruition: extremely crude psychological characterisation of the gallery of down-and-outs, lushly melodramatic score, explicit statement of themes by several of the characters for anyone who's missed the point, grossly stylised acting and design (particularly the use of colour symbolism, this being Kurosawa's first film in colour). Nevertheless, there's a laudable fluidity in the way the characters are knitted together into a cyclical narrative, and some of them have moments of quiet poignancy.[/quote]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/danchaabn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/danchaabn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/danciaabn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/danciaabn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/danckaabn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/danckaabn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----[color=Red]my rip from the Criterion release[/color]----\n\n[i]\n~~~~~~ Dodesukaden.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................2,090,571,776                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:20:10                \nFrame Count:....................................201637             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................592                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................432                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.370                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1787                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.291&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................1 [/i]          \n\n\n[quote]Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
