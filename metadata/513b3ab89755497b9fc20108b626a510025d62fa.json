It turned into a movement.\nIn 1998, when Nick Saul became executive director of The Stop, the little urban food bank was like thousands of other cramped, dreary, makeshift spaces, a last-hope refuge where desperate people could stave off hunger for one more day with a hamper full of canned salt, sugar and fat.\nThe produce was wilted and the packaged foods were food-industry castoffsÃ¢â‚¬â€mislabelled products and misguided experiments that no one wanted to buy. For users of the food bank, knowing that this was their best bet for a meal was a humiliating experience.\nSince that time, The Stop has undergone a radical reinvention. Participation has overcome embarrassment, and the isolation of poverty has been replaced with a vibrant community that uses food to build hope and skills, and to reach out to those who need a meal, a hand and a voice. It is now a thriving, internationally respected Community Food Centre with gardens, kitchens, a greenhouse, farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ markets and a mission to revolutionize our food system. Celebrities and benefactors have embraced the vision because they have never seen anything like The Stop. Best of all, fourteen years after his journey started, Nick Saul is introducing this neighbourhood success story to the world.\nIn telling the remarkable story of The StopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transformation, Saul and Curtis argue that we need a new politics of food, one in which everyone has a dignified, healthy place at the table. By turns funny, sad and raw, The Stop is a timely story about overcoming obstacles, challenging sacred cows and creating lasting change","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513b3ab89755497b9fc20108b626a510025d62fa","amp;dn":"The+Stop+How+the+Fight+for+Good+Food+Transformed+a+Community+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513b3ab89755497b9fc20108b626a510025d62fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,59,58,184,151,85,73,123,159,194,1,8,182,38,165,16,2,93,98,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
