Everything from standards analysis to characterization of the design is covered in the book. GPS &amp; Galileo focuses on developing seamlessly interoperable receivers that can access the wide variety of new services offered by these systems, such as increased service availability, centimeter-sensitive accuracy, emergency management, and data confidentiality. By the end of the book, you will have a prototype that achieves peak performance in terms of gain, NF, and current consumption, making it suitable for any high-accuracy, portable application. Discover how to: Determine the specifications of an interoperable dual GPS/Galileo RF front-end Design all RFIC blocks, including the receiver chain, PLL, control logic, and PADs Select the required external components Implement optimal floor planning Perform validation testing of the integrated RF front-end Understand real-world fields of application Gauge the performance of the front-end within a receiver linked to a full-solution platform.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07dfa7fbfa7e2a8a66ceb76a0378f4511c103272","amp;dn":"GPS+%26+Galileo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07dfa7fbfa7e2a8a66ceb76a0378f4511c103272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,223,167,251,250,126,42,138,102,206,183,106,3,120,244,81,28,16,50,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
