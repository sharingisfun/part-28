But as always, Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: &quot;Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?&quot; &quot;I've had enough of this violence&quot; Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent among these groups is the &quot;Red Alert Syndicate&quot;, growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks, but apparently do more than that. One of their members, Axl, decides he's had enough of their &quot;murdering&quot; and tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl back.\n\nAxl is chased by a mechaniloid sent by Red Alert to retrieve him, and their chase causes havoc that calls for the Maverick Hunter Zero to investigate the area. After a quick meeting and battle against the mechaniloid, Zero takes Axl into custody at Hunter HQ. With this action, Red issues a challenge to the Hunters: he will release some Mavericks that Red Alert has in captivity, and whichever group can defeat the Mavericks first will gain custody of Axl. Zero goes into the action without hesitation, and Axl's remorse for what he has done fuels his desire to become a Maverick Hunter. With no word from X, Axl promises to impress the former hunter. X stays behind, trying to find a more peaceful solution to what he views as another pointless conflict. Eventually, X decides that his involvement in is required to assure a quick end to the bloody war. Alia then finds out the location of Red Alert main base. The hunters enter the Crimson Palace and find a rebuilt Sigma. Sigma is eventually defeated and X reluctantly promotes Axl to become an official Maverick Hunter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGameplay\nMega Man X7 is the first and only game in the Mega Man X series where the main protagonist, X is not available as a playable character from the beginning of the game.
