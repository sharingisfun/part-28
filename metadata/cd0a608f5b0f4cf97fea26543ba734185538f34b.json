People I didn't necessarily know.  Lately, it seems, I'm the go-to person to fix various computer problems.  And it's always an extra cool feeling to see some Christian music, Christian wallpaper, or some other form of Christ on those hard drives.  To learn that you're helping out a fellow Believer.\n\nAnd yet it's even more, dare I say &quot;humbling&quot;, to learn they've been downloading some of these &quot;The Year In Christian Music&quot; bundles.  And they don't even know it's me who has been torrenting them.\n\n&quot;I really like Beckah Shae, and Matthew West.  I discovered them in some of these music bundles&quot;, one person told me.\n\nGod's clearly at work here my friends.  Please add to that by doing your part.  Burn a disc for a friend.  Continue to torrent a day or two longer than normal.  Encourage your children to learn a new Christian song tomorrow.  Introduce a neighbor to a Christian artist this weekend.  Play some Christian, instead of secular, on your drive into work tomorrow morning.  But most of all, thank God almighty for His merciful glory in all things, including these songs we're able to share with one another here today.\n\nFor those keeping count, we're now up to 491 releases for 2013.\n\nThis 19th bundle includes the following 22 titles...\n\n * Allan Scott - 2013 - God In Me - Single\n * Brotha Dre - 2013 - The Second Coming\n * Building 429 - 2013 - We Won't Be Shaken\n * David M Edwards - 2013 - Heart Full Of Soul\n * Eisley - 2013 - Currents - Deluxe Edition\n * Gideonz Army - 2013 - The Truth Unveiled - With T-Haddy\n * Jason Walker - 2013 - Keep Me Watching\n * Jose Ruiz - 2013 - Overflow\n * Life At Opwekking - 2013 - Breaking News\n * Matt Brock - 2013 - From The Land Of Shadows\n * Nathan Jess - 2013 - Love Stands Forever\n * PJ Morton - 2013 - New Orleans - Deluxe Version\n * Relient K - 2013 - Collapsible Lung\n * Remedy Drive - 2013 - Resuscitate - Acoustic Sessions\n * Robert Orndoff And Disciple 13 - 2013 - One Day At A Time\n * Sleeping At Last - 2013 - Atlas 02 - Light EP\n * Still Trill Christians - 2013 - No Sex - Single\n * Tim Neufeld - 2013 - Trees\n * Tim Timmons - 2013 - Cast My Cares\n * Various - 2013 - Overdose Of The Holy Ghost\n * Vocal Few - 2013 - Tall Trees EP\n * Yancy - 2013 - Roots For The Journey\n\nPraising Him,\nTorrentTracts - June 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0a608f5b0f4cf97fea26543ba734185538f34b","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+19%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0a608f5b0f4cf97fea26543ba734185538f34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,10,96,143,91,15,76,249,127,234,38,84,59,167,52,24,85,56,243,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
