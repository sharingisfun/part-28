The scenes that had been filmed were released on VHS in 1992, with linking naration by Tom Baker (who played the Doctor at the time). In 2003, the BBC commissioned Big Finish to remake this &quot;lost&quot; story as a radio play, and published it in 2005 on BBCi with accompanying (limited) Flash animation.\n\nThis is the 2005 Flash animation version of Shada, released on the 2013 DVD publication of Shada.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada#Big_Finish_version_.282003.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada#Big_Finish_version_.282003.29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Doctor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul McGann (Eighth Doctor)\nRomana II Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lalla Ward\nK-9 Mk.
