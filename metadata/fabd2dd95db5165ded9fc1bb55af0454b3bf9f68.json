Berger returns to the\ncave six weeks later with a team of elite scientists and finds not just one\nhuman skeleton, but several, unlike any he has ever seen. Measurements show\nthat these people were some of the smallest humans to walk the earth, but they\nhad enormous teeth. Has Berger discovered a lost human species or a tribe of\nmutants?\n\nThe story of human evolution is filled with unexpected twists and turns. In\n2004, a groundbreaking discovery made headlines around the world when\nscientists revealed evidence of a lost human species on the remote Indonesian\nisland of Flores. Researchers believe Homo floresiensis, nicknamed &quot;The\nHobbit,&quot; shared the earth with modern humans for at least 80,000 years. Is it\npossible that a wandering tribe of hobbit-like humans made their way 1,800\nmiles from Flores to Palau?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 2061 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x432\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.593:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 47:22.600\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 744MB\nSubtitles: No\nRipped by: jvt40\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Ape Man\n* Journey of Man\n* DNA Mysteries: The Search for Adam\n* The Real Eve\n* The Ascent of Man\n* Riddle of the Human Hobbits\n* Walking with Cavemen\n\n2) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Lost_Tribe_of_Palau","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fabd2dd95db5165ded9fc1bb55af0454b3bf9f68","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Lost.Tribe.of.Palau.DVB.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fabd2dd95db5165ded9fc1bb55af0454b3bf9f68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,189,45,217,93,181,22,93,237,159,193,187,85,175,4,84,179,191,159,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
