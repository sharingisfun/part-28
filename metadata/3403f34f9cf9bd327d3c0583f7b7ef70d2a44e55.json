Cataldo, T. Da Ros (Springer, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nFullerenes and nanotubes are two classes of carbon structures or allotropes, which were discovered about 17 years ago. Since that time, many chemical derivatives have been synthesized using fullerenes and nanotubes as building blocks.\r\n\r\nParticularly promising was the theory that the chemical properties of fullerenes, and certain derivatives, made them likely candidates for anticancer drugs, inhibitors of viruses such as HIV, or even as anti-bacterials. Their cyctotoxicity can also be controlled by specific circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the funtionalization of nanotubes has not only produced relatively simple derivatives, but also complex hybrids with biological macromolecules, which show unique supramolecular architecture and which are promising in many medical applications.\r\n\r\nThe application of fullerenes and nanotubes in medicine is at the frontier of our knowledge, thus the work in this field represents the basis for future novel developments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3403f34f9cf9bd327d3c0583f7b7ef70d2a44e55","amp;dn":"Medicinal+Chemistry+and+Pharmacological+Potential+of+Fullerenes+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3403f34f9cf9bd327d3c0583f7b7ef70d2a44e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,3,243,79,156,249,189,50,125,60,5,131,247,183,239,112,210,164,78,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
