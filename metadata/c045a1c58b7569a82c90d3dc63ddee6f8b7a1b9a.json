In fact, some of these seem almost to be Jimmy McGriff sessions for the most part, where Jacquet gets a prominent role, probably dating between 1966 and 1970 or so. The material here is as good a showcase for McGriff, electric keyboardman Kenny Baron, and guitarist George Freeman as it is for Jacquet, who is surprisingly in the background on a lot of what's here. All of the playing is impressive, with much of what's here downright dazzling (check out &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; and &quot;It Don't Mean a Thing&quot;). Strangely enough, for a disc supposedly showcasing Jacquet, it is George Freeman who gets a lot of the spotlight throughout, especially on the blues intrumental &quot;How Long,&quot; where he shares center stage with Jacquet.
