Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03440114298b5f596cbf9c9bc6cd1de82ffb345","amp;dn":"Battle+Cards+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03440114298b5f596cbf9c9bc6cd1de82ffb345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,52,64,17,66,152,181,245,150,203,249,201,188,108,209,222,130,255,179,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
