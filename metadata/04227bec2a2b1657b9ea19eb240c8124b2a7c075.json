Directed by John Dahl and starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton, the movie follows two friends who need to quickly earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a huge debt. The term &quot;rounder&quot; refers to a person whose sole means of earning a living is by playing cards.\n\nThe movie opened to mixed reviews and made only a modest amount of money. However, with the growing popularity of Texas hold 'em and other poker games, Rounders has become a cult hit.\n\n\nSmart Money (1931)\n\nSmart Money (film)\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nSmart Money \n \nDirected by Alfred E.

Robinson and James Cagney, the only time Robinson and Cagney made a movie together, despite being the two leading gangster actors at Warner Brothers studios all through the 1930s. Smart Money was shot after Robinson's signature film Little Caesar had been released and while Cagney's breakthrough masterpiece The Public Enemy was also being filmed. The Public Enemy had not been released and so Smart Money is the only film in which Cagney played the kind of supporting role usually done by Humphrey Bogart later in the '30s. Robinson plays a barber who goes to the big city to become a gambler but finds himself rooked by a blonde and a gang of thugs, whereupon he vows to take revenge, with the help of his own henchman in the formidable form of Cagney. The movie was directed by Alfred E. Green.\n\nA gentle-spirited film, Smart Money features some intriguing Cagney sequences, particularly a pre-Code pantomime of cunnilingus. Critics noted how well Robinson and Cagney played off each other but this was their only screen pairing (some cinema aficionados refer to this dilemma as the &quot;Gene Autry-Roy Rogers effect&quot; or the &quot;John Wayne-Gary Cooper effect&quot; or the &quot;Cary Grant-any other commensurately important actor effect;&quot; it's rather like Wild West gunslingers reluctant to go up against each other).\n\nBoris Karloff, not yet the icon he would soon become following his performance in Frankenstein that same year, has a brief role early in this film.\n\nMargaret Livingston, who plays the District Attorney's girlfriend, had portrayed the &quot;Woman from the City&quot; in F. W. Murnau's 1927 masterpiece Sunrise.\n\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid (1965)\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nThe Cincinnati Kid \n \nDirected by Norman Jewison \nProduced by Martin Ransohoff \nWritten by Richard Jessup (novel)\nRing Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern (screenplay) \nStarring Steve McQueen\nEdward G.

Lathrop \nEditing by Hal Ashby \nDistributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \nRelease date(s) October 15, 1965 \nRunning time 102 min. \nLanguage English \nThe Cincinnati Kid is a 1965 film. It tells the story of Eric &quot;The Kid&quot; Stoner, a young Depression-era poker player, as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best. This quest leads him to challenge Lancey &quot;The Man&quot; Howard, an older player widely considered to be the best, culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two.\n\nThe script, adapted from Richard Jessup's novel, was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern; it was Lardner's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten.[1] The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard. Jewison, who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began[1], describes The Cincinnati Kid as his &quot;ugly duckling&quot; film. He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects.[2]\n\nThe film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances.\n\n\nYonkers Joe (2008)\n\nYonkers Joe (2008)T-Meter Critics Top Critics RT Community My Critics My Friends DVD 57 % Tomatometer\n \nHow does the Tomatometer work \nReviews Counted: 21\n\nFresh: 12\nRotten:9\nAverage Rating: 5.4/10\nConsensus: A solid cast adds subtlety to this otherwise schmaltzy and sometimes awkward gambling-flick-cum-family-drama.\n\nRated: R [See Full Rating] for language including sexual references. \n\nRuntime: 1 hr 42 mins\n\nGenre: Dramas\nTheatrical Release:Jan 9, 2009 Limited\nSynopsis: Yonkers Joe is an exciting, high-stakes con film and moving family drama written and directed by Robert Celestino, and starring Academy Award-nominee Chazz Palminteri, Academy Award-winner...
