When Mount     \n         Vesuvius erupted, it rained 8 million tons of debris          \n         onto Pompeii it sealed the fate of more than a thousand       \n         people. But it also sealed the city form the world:           \n         preserved it, protected it, like nowhere else on earth,       \n         the rediscovered Pompeii gives us access to the ancient       \n         world. And now, with new findings and new insights, we can    \n         tell the story of the ordinary people caught up in this       \n         disaster. These are the forgotten men and women who lived     \n          when Rome ruled....and were buried when the volcano blew.     \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
