He befriends a prostitute by the name of Gulabji, who invites him to spend the night with her, and when he refuses, she re-directs him to Lillian who rents out rooms. Ranbir meets with Lillian, who has been living alone for 37 years after her son, Vincent, left to join the army and did not return, charms her, and rents a room from her. He gets a job as a singer in a local restaurant. On the occasion of Eid, while returning home, he comes across a woman standing on the bridge. He finds her very attractive, befriends her, walks her home, finds out her name is Sakina, who is a carpet weaver and lives with her aunt and blind grandma. Just when Ranbir is about to confess his love, she tells him that she has already given her heart to Imaan, a former tenant of her grandmother's. Imaan had left, promising to return on Eid, but has not done so. She finds out that he may be staying at the Momim Lodge and asks Ranbir to deliver a letter to him. A crestfallen Ranbir destroys the letter, but does go to Momim Lodge, and this is where he finds that no one by the name of Imaan had ever lived there. Encouraged by this news, he returns back and attempts to win Sakina's heart. The question remains will he succeed or will Sakina spend the rest of her life waiting for Imaan's return?\n\nCast:\n\n\tRanbir Kapoor\t ... \tRanbir Raj\n\tSonam Kapoor\t ... \tSakina\n\tSalman Khan\t ... \tImaan\n\tRani Mukherjee\t ... \tGulabji\n\tZohra Sehgal\t ... \tLillian 'Lilipop'\n\n  Rest of cast listed alphabetically:\n\n\tBegum Para\t ... \tSakina's grandmother\n\tVibhu Puri\t ... \tStranger in the rain\n\n------------------------------------------------\n                   Video\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFormat...........................: AVC/H264\nFormat/Info......................: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile...................: High @ L5.1\nFormat settings, ReFrames........: 3 frames\nBit rate mode....................: Variable\nBit rate.........................: 877 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate.................: 4020 Kbps\nResolution.......................: 704 pixels x 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio.............: 2.444\nFrame rate(mode).................: 23.976 fps(Constant)\nScan type........................: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)...............: 0.180\nStream size......................: 864 MiB (87%)\nWriting library..................: x264 core 58 svn-736bm\n\n------------------------------------------------\n                   Audio\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFormat...........................: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version...................: Version 4\nFormat profile...................: LC\nBit rate mode....................: Variable\nBit rate.........................: 125 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate.................: 229 Kbps\nChannel(s).......................: 2 channels\nChannel positions................: L R\nSampling rate....................: 48.0 KHz\nResolution.......................: 16 bits\nStream size......................: 123 MiB (12%)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8564fd120e2d3b396995e8441bffc2d467d7d1c7","amp;dn":"Saawariya%5BXPLOSiON%5D%5Bmattlb0619%5D%5BH264-AAC%5D%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8564fd120e2d3b396995e8441bffc2d467d7d1c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,100,253,18,14,45,59,57,105,149,232,68,27,255,194,212,103,215,209,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
