Competitions\n involve performing tricks (aerial jumps, bar spins, back flips) throughout\n various levels -- the idea is to rake in a sponsorship and enhance your bike.\n After a trick has been executed, a letter appears at the bottom of the screen;\n once you spell out the complete word, you move on to the next level.\n\n Featuring 3D visuals and accelerator support, there are 12 levels in all, each\n with its own unique textures and environments. There are outdoor courses in\n which you'll leap white-picket fences, basketball courts and indoor\n half-pipes. After completing a level, you can use your winnings and go to the\n local bike shop. Here, you choose from a variety of tricked-out bikes, each\n with its own weight and performance specifications.\n\n Released as part of Activision's Value Software line, Freestyle BMX: Featuring\n Brian Foster &amp; Joey Garcia also features time limits and scoring for\n individual tricks. In order to make use of the 3D acceleration, you need a\n video card that supports Direct 3D.\n\nTracker:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubscribe:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/a0ff44ac180469d9a5486baa57ae7833&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/a0ff44ac180469d9a5486baa57ae7833&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67075adc15c020ad1313bab1c5cf17adc43ef318","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D+Freestyle+BMX%3A+Featuring+Brian+Foster+%26+Joey+Garcia+%5BISO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67075adc15c020ad1313bab1c5cf17adc43ef318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,7,90,220,21,192,32,173,19,19,186,177,197,207,23,173,196,62,243,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
