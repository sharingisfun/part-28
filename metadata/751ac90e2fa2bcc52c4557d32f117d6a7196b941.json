An idea starting back in 2004 as nothing more than a &quot;fun project&quot; BROOKROYAL did not officially begin until May of 2007. When Jack Wiese, Jason Zykan, Bon Lohman, Adam Stewart, &amp; David Brown decided to fuse their musical talent, passion and compelling stage presence to form the band BROOKROYAL. Lead singer Jack Weise believes: &quot;Brookroyal is five best friends that not only found each other but were given the opportunity to create music and perform together.&quot; Anyone who has seen BROOKROYAL live will attest to the band taking full advantage of this opportunity as their collective energy, combined talent and love of music is injected, and is very evident, in each show. BROOKROYAL exploded onto the St. Louis scene with a mission to rise quickly and that they did ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751ac90e2fa2bcc52c4557d32f117d6a7196b941","amp;dn":"Brookroyal+-+There+Was+a+Time+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751ac90e2fa2bcc52c4557d32f117d6a7196b941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,26,201,14,47,162,188,197,44,69,87,211,47,17,125,106,113,150,185,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
