If you do, along with this book, you've got everything you need to make amazing photography. \r\n\r\nThe first three chapters of the book use digital photography history to give you an overview of the capabilities that you can employ, and the remainder of the book is focused on hands on techniques of iphoneography so that you are getting professional results. \r\n\r\nThis title uses the iPhone and iPhone apps in its examples; your own smart phone and individual apps may be different, but the techniques you'll gain from this book, and the insights into your own creative potential are not dependent on specific equipment.\r\n\r\nMaybe you occasionally take a great shot with your smartphone camera but you wonder what you need to keep doing right to make that kind of difference in all your shots. Maybe you're suspecting that you no longer need to lug around a DSLR camera to bring home great photographs. And maybe you just get a charge out of capturing inspired moments and sharing them in all the glory deserve with others.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL LEARN:\r\nâ€¢ An understanding of the methods used in DSLR photography vs iPhoneography. \r\nâ€¢ The connection between the iPhone and the artist.  \r\nâ€¢ Practical tips and techniques for creating photos and art with your iPhone. \r\nâ€¢ Taking your visions further with discovery and chance explorations.\r\nâ€¢ Connecting with the iPhoneography and iPhone Art community. \r\n  \r\nWHO THIS BOOK IS FOR:\r\nThe audience is threefold:\r\n\r\n1.) Amateur photographers who already sense that their smartphone is the only tool they truly need in order to grow their skills\r\n\r\n2.) Serious photographers who are part of the growing &quot;mobile art&quot; movement that emphasizes creative eye over hardware\r\n\r\n3.) Anyone with a smartphone who wants to take better photos (because anyone with a smartphone is already taking photos with regularity anyway)\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoy...\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                   .:.Shailab.:.\r\n\r\n\t             https://thepiratebay.se/user/shailab/\r\n\r\n                           https://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f85e4dbd7aec194e466e9162e753c0a78b3c4b3","amp;dn":"iPhoneography+-+Michael+Clawson+148421756X+%28Shailab%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f85e4dbd7aec194e466e9162e753c0a78b3c4b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,133,228,219,215,174,193,148,228,102,233,22,46,117,60,10,120,179,196,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
