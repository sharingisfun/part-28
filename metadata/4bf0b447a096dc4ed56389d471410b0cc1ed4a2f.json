The most exciting book on music in years. A book of treasure, a book of discovery, a book to open your ears to new worlds of pleasure. Doing for music what Patricia SchultzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½author of the phenomenal 1,000 Places to See Before You DieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½does for travel, Tom Moon recommends 1,000 recordings guaranteed to give listeners the joy, the mystery, the revelation, the sheer fun of great music.\n\nThis is a book both broad and deep, drawing from the diverse worlds of classical, jazz, rock, pop, blues, country, folk, musicals, hip-hop, world, opera, soundtracks, and more. It's arranged alphabetically by artist to create the kind of unexpected juxtapositions that break down genre bias and broaden listenersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ horizonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it makes every listener a seeker, actively pursuing new artists and new sounds, and reconfirming the greatness of the classics. Flanking J. S. Bach and his six entries, for example, are the little-known R&amp;B singer Baby Huey and the '80s Rastafarian hard-core punk band Bad Brains. Farther down the list: The Band, Samuel Barber, Cecelia Bartoli, Count Basie, and Afropop star Waldemer Bastos.\n\nEach entry is passionately written, with expert listening notes, fascinating anecdotes, and the occasional perfect quoteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Your collection could be filled with nothing but music from Ray Charles,&quot; said Tom Waits, &quot;and you'd have a completely balanced diet.&quot; Every entry identifies key tracks, additional works by the artist, and where to go next. And in the back, indexes and playlists for different moods and occasions.\n\nFrom the Back Cover:\nCelebrate the joy, the revelation, the mystery, the fun, the sheer shivers-up-the-spine pleasure of great music. Essential operas. Milestone rock albums. An education in the blues. The world of world. Classical from Bach to BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k to Beethoven to Brahms. And dozens of unexpected gems, surprising discoveries, and long-lost masterpieces. The entries are arranged alphabetically, to break down genre bias and broaden every listenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s horizonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½think Miles Davis to Claude Debussy to the melodic story-songs of The Decemberists. And the writing is passionate, informed, opinionated. Includes indexes for every mood and occasion.\n\nSee also:\nforums.php?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=26025&amp;page=1 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.1000recordings.com/the-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.1000recordings.com/the-list/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf0b447a096dc4ed56389d471410b0cc1ed4a2f","amp;dn":"1000+Recordings+To+Hear+Before+You+Die+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf0b447a096dc4ed56389d471410b0cc1ed4a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,240,180,71,160,150,220,78,213,99,137,212,113,65,11,12,193,237,74,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
