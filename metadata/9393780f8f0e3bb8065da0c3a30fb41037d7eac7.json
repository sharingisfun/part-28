Around 7,000 publicly-funded schools - one in three - now has a religious affiliation.\n\nAs the coalition government paves the way for more faith-based education by promoting 'free schools', the renowned atheist and evolutionary biologist Professor Richard Dawkins says enough is enough.\n\nIn this passionately argued film, Dawkins calls on us to reconsider the consequences of faith education, which, he argues, bamboozles parents and indoctrinates and divides children.\n\nThe film features robust exchanges with former Secretary of State for Education Charles Clarke, Head of the Church of England Education Service Reverend Janina Ainsworth, and the Chair of the Association of Muslim Schools, Dr Mohammed Mukadam.\n\nIt also features insights from child psychologists and key players in faith education as well as insights from both parents and pupils.\n\nDawkins also draws on his own personal history as a father, arguing that the government must stop funding new faith schools, and urges society to respect a child's right to freedom of belief.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9393780f8f0e3bb8065da0c3a30fb41037d7eac7","amp;dn":"Richard+Dawkins%5C%27+Age+of+Reason+-+Faith+School+Menace%3F+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9393780f8f0e3bb8065da0c3a30fb41037d7eac7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,147,120,15,143,14,59,184,6,93,160,195,163,15,180,16,55,215,234,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
