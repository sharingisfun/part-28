And what was with this guy? Yeah, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hot and all, with eyes like melted chocolate and a lean, sexy figure sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to explore, but RemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never met anyone so rigid. Owen has a list for everything. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s planned the entire day down to the smallest detail. All Remy has to do is stick to the list, but she never follows the rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no freaking way. So why is she spending all her time looking in the rearview mirror, hoping sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make OwenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next list?\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05efb157dbfe336ceddd8c1fca39070fc2441ef","amp;dn":"On+His+List+%28Entangled+Flirts%29+-+Sparrow%2C+Wendy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05efb157dbfe336ceddd8c1fca39070fc2441ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,94,251,21,125,191,227,54,206,221,216,193,252,163,144,112,252,36,65,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
