Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re spilling Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem, getting up in Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem, or proving you have Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem, the BZZZZZZZZZ will toss a medal around your neck like the final shot from A New Hope. So, if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the criteria, Nutrition has got sixteen minute abs. These guys take the ADHD pen-wielding pundits to task and, really, anyone who thinks the long song canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be done in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s data-rich age of info overload. Oh, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the ticks and/or tocks for sixteen minute melo-inflected, death-leaning extreme metal? Fine, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll clog the B-side with a thirteen minute jam just as an eff-you. For everyone else willing and able to sit still, Terminus Occultus will spin you a tale by taking the scenic route. Musically, this will surely play well for folks familiar with Akercocke. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less austere for sure, but it finds a similar seamstress to sew together the varied fabrics of death metal, thrash, black metal, and melo. Think, too, a less over-the-top Bal-Sagoth with the Lovecraft whited-out by BiomechanicalÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs industrial lurch. If you want to leap right in, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IIIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ thrashes with necro trems nearly right from the start and then transitions seamlessly to ripping death before you even notice it. Though, know this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t style bird spotting. Its strength is its cohesiveness. The flow doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need duct tape. Nope, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like a wormhole. Hit play and double digit minutes drain away. Goodbye workday. Nutrition is one of the better ways to get thirty minutes older in just two songs and a segue.&quot;\n\n\n\n================================================\n\nIn early 2009 artist/writer and ex-vocalist\nof Tokyo's Detritum, Jeremy Mauney, had the\nidea to create a black metal band with sci-fi\nelements basing song/lyrical content around his\nown extraterrestrial research.\nAfter posting classified ads online looking for\ninterested musicians, Jeremy was approached by\nRoland La Goy (of Inlaid Rust and Molestation).\nIdeas were exchanged, and NUTRITION was born.\n\n\nJEREMY MAUNEY:\nvocals/lyrics\nmusical concepts\nall artwork\n----------------\nROLAND LA GOY:\nguitar/bass\ndrums\nsynth/keys\nproduction\n\n\nThe lyrical content of NUTRITION's songs\nfocus on detailed 'extraterrestrial' research,\nancient astronauts, and the truth of Earth's history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac791ec6a717ad6afff50cd8c000233c7e7b9677","amp;dn":"%5BBlack+Metal%5D+NUTRITION+-+Terminus+Occultus+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac791ec6a717ad6afff50cd8c000233c7e7b9677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,121,30,198,167,23,173,106,255,245,12,216,192,0,35,60,126,123,150,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
