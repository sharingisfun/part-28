The alto saxophonist's tone has a bit of a bluesy edge throughout the sessions, as if he is reminiscing about a past love. His heartfelt rendition of &quot;My Ideal&quot; stands out, as do his two interpretations of songs by Nicholas Brodszky, &quot;Be My Love&quot; and &quot;Love Letters.&quot; McPherson picks up the tempo with &quot;I Didn't Know What Time It Was,&quot; though his tone doesn't shift to a lighter mood. The relaxed mood makes this release perfect for late-night listening. The only drawback with this CD is the ugly cover photo, which McPherson denounced as very tasteless during a 2007 interview.
