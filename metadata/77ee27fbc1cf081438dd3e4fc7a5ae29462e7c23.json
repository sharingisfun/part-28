The source for this fanedit was the excellent Battlestar Galactica Blu-Ray set and used the 1080p/5.1 Razor (Unrated) movie and the 480p/2.0 Razor Flashbacks. All of the Razor Flashbacks episodes 3, 4, 5, 6 and part of 7 are contained within the Razor (Unrated) movie which is 1080p with surround sound.\r\n\r\n00.00-02.30 Razor Flashbacks episode1 480p\r\n02.30-04.54 Razor Flashbacks episode2 480p\r\n04.54-15.08 Razor (Unrated) 1080p\r\n15.08-18.21 Razor Flashbacks episode7 480p\r\n\r\nEpisode7 only has 1minute 17seconds of content, the rest is credits and the hilarious R&amp;D TV stinger at the very end:\r\n15.07-16.25 Razor Flashbacks episode7 flash forward to Galactica's decommissioning\r\n16.25-18.16 Razor Flashbacks credits\r\n18.16-18.20 R&amp;D TV stinger with David saying &quot;me, me, me ...&quot; and Ron pushing his stomach in and saying &quot;big head&quot;\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* hid the &quot;TO BE CONTINUED&quot; text overlays and removed the associated sound effects at the end of episode 1 and episode 2\r\n* removed the episode 2 establishing shot of an exterior zoom into Galactica\r\n* left the very funny R&amp;D stinger from the very end of episode 7 after the credits; this R&amp;D stinger wasn't used at the end of any normal episodes so it's a bit of an Easter Egg\r\n\r\nNote: The webisodes are stereo 2.0 and the Razor (Unrated) material is surround 5.1. The final file is mastered as 5.1 and the sound levels sound about right with surround speakers but listening with just stereo speakers might make the webisodes sound a bit louder than the movie portion. If the video player has a speaker setting, be sure to set it to 2.0 if you only have stereo speakers.\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of Battlestar Galactica, Gotham, MST3K, Rifftrax, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77ee27fbc1cf081438dd3e4fc7a5ae29462e7c23","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+Razor+Flashbacks+Complete+v3+1080p+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77ee27fbc1cf081438dd3e4fc7a5ae29462e7c23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,238,39,251,193,207,8,20,56,221,62,79,199,165,174,41,70,46,124,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
