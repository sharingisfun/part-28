It asks one simple question â€“ how will you die? \r\n\r\nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming â€“ their continued survival relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde.\r\nCurrent Features\r\n\r\n    Hardcore Sandbox Zombie Survival Game with a focus on realistic survival.\r\n    Online multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers.\r\n    Local 4 player split-screen co-op\r\n    Hundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual and hearing systems.\r\n    Full line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics. Hide in the shadows, keep quiet and keep the lights off at night, or at least hang sheets over the windows.\r\n    Vast and growing map (loosely based on a real world location) for you to explore, loot and set up your fortress. Check out Blindcoderâ€™s map project: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/\r\n    Use tools and items to craft weapons, barricade and cook. You can even build zombie proof forts by chopping trees, sawing wood and scavenging supplies.\r\n    Deal with depression, boredom, hunger, thirst and illness while trying to survive.\r\n    Day turns to night. The electricity falters. Hordes migrate. Winter draws in. Nature gradually starts to take over.\r\n    Farming, trapping, fishing, carpentry, cooking, trapping, character customization, skills and perks that develop based on what you do in-game.\r\n    Proper zombies that donâ€™t run.
