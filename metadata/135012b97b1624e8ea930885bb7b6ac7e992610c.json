The vocalists will be pitted against each other in further head-to-head battles, this time choosing their own songs, although they won't know who they're up against until the moment they're chosen to take the stage. Up for grabs is a place in Friday's quarter-finals.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:135012b97b1624e8ea930885bb7b6ac7e992610c","amp;dn":"The.Voice.UK.S02E10.PDTVx264.JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"135012b97b1624e8ea930885bb7b6ac7e992610c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,80,18,185,123,22,36,232,234,147,8,133,187,123,106,199,233,146,97,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
