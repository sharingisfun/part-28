As he moves his way up the ladder, a schoolteacher tries to reform him, his aunt tries to seduce him, and the &quot;weedheads&quot; are eager to use his newly found enterprise, but he has his own agenda. After an altercation involving fast cars, hidden drugs, and police, he's accepted by the drug kingpin and is off into the big leagues. A typical morality play of the era, filled with a naive view of drugs, nihilistic beat poetry, and some incredible '50s slang.\n\nNOTES:-\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $1,290,000 in the US and Canada and $625,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $578,000. However the follow up films Zugsmith made for the studio - Girl Town, The Beat Generation and Platinum High School - all lost money.\n\nThis film in sampled on White Zombie's album La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1 on four separate occasions. The &quot;Do you want to start a rumble?&quot; conversation, the &quot;Drop it, buster!&quot; line, the &quot;tomorrow's a drag&quot; poem, and the Columbus speech (&quot;the only thing square about this world...&quot;).\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 955 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 85 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f572816fc4bf2684245d986b5b619a08b006141","amp;dn":"High+School+Confidential+%281958%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Mamie+Van+Doren%2C+Russ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f572816fc4bf2684245d986b5b619a08b006141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,87,40,22,252,75,242,104,66,69,217,134,181,182,25,160,139,0,97,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
