Unfortunately, unlike his siblings, Arthur hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t broken a single, solitary world record! But when the Whipples suffer a spate of catastrophes and a curious amount of attention from a pair of irregularly sized and unusually menacing clowns, Arthur might be the only one who can save his family from losing their collective crown . . . or worse.\n\nA 2013 BOOK EXPO AMERICA (BEA) BUZZ PANEL SELECTION!\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGr 3-6-Poor Arthur Whipple. He's about to turn 12 and has yet to distinguish himself among his huge family of overachieving world-record breakers. From failing to achieve the &quot;Longest Time without Sleeping&quot; record to flubbing the one for standing on one foot, Arthur's efforts to contribute to his family's fame are proving elusive. But when a mysterious curse seems to befall the Whipples, it might be up to Arthur to save them. As the mysteries pile up and the Whipple clan finds itself on the losing side of the World Record Championships, the young hero turns his talents to ferreting out clues and suspects behind his family's misfortunes. This novel's pace is frenetic; the action is over-the-top, as are the myriad world records (e.g., &quot;The World's Largest Piece of French Toast,&quot; &quot;Longest Continuous Time Playing an Accordion&quot;). Think vaudeville on a roller coaster. There's humor and mayhem, and red herrings and nefarious suspects abound. The pace may delight some readers, while others will become exhausted. Even those who love it may feel frustrated that the mystery is not solved and they must hang on for a second installment. Give this one to readers with solid attention spans.-Brenda Kahn, Tenakill Middle School, Closter, NJÃŽÂ±(c) Copyright 2013. Library Journal. LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

A genuinely fun and comically ludicrous romp, clearly worthy of Most World Records Outside of a World Records Book.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;One of the most fun listening experiences of the year.&quot; --Publishers Weekly on the audio edition, starred review\n\n&quot;First-time author Matthew Ward's constant parade of sight gags, stage business, and preposterous feats is highly entertaining.&quot; --Common Sense Media\n\n&quot;A rollicking, record-breaking romp, running rife with riotous ribaldry! And featuring even more r's than this quote!&quot;--Robert Paul Weston, award-winning author of Zorgamazoo and The Creature Department","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85dd71c2dea60ea7af16fcd674af6dfe039d4ee6","amp;dn":"The+Fantastic+Family+Whipple+-+Matthew+Ward.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85dd71c2dea60ea7af16fcd674af6dfe039d4ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,221,113,194,222,166,14,167,175,22,252,214,116,175,109,254,3,157,78,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
