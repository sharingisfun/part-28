As man extends into remote reaches of the globe and large populations encounter environmental changes at an ever-increasing rate, this medicine of exploration, adventure, travel, and disaster response has become indispensable. Although much of the medicine practiced in remote areas or under environmental extremes is emergency in nature, and local conditions and considerations by necessity dominate, the field of wilderness medicine has advanced beyond the exciting rescues of extreme alpinists and survivalists. It has expanded in scope to include the practice of medicine in situations of constrained resources, during times of catastrophe, and often in impoverished countries. In noble responses to events that generate urgent and profound medical needs, practitioners skilled in wilderness medicine have become rescuers and leaders noted for their resourcefulness and rugged practicality. Because humans continually try to dominate the landscape in their disregard for the environment and fellow man, nature is the force with which we must constantly reckon. All major hazards ultimately involve the power and energy of mighty winds, harsh solar radiation, extreme cold, and the like.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf070de67faa894ec9fb85c54423e0ed8b9c2a10","amp;dn":"WILDERNESS+MEDICINE+-+5th+Edn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf070de67faa894ec9fb85c54423e0ed8b9c2a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,7,13,230,127,170,137,78,201,251,133,197,68,35,224,237,139,156,42,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
