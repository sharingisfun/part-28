But that's about all they have in common. Ryan has spent the last decade in China building his career as a documentary photographer. Colin stayed closer to home, in Toronto, and built up his own successful currency trading company, which he recently resigned from. Together they have just completed a 65 day - 18,000km - motorcycle journey around China. They have traveled through some of the country's most populous and remote regions, while at the same time making a documentary film. The purpose of the film is to put China on display. To explore the visual and cultural wonders that is China. With a massive population, crowded cities, abundant minorities and its stunning natural landscape; China offers a traveler an experience like no other. And we're hoping you'll come along for the ride, on one of the world's greatest adventures. Our films title is: &quot;The Middle Kingdom Ride&quot;, as China's historical name was once &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Shanghai to the North Korean Border \r\nColin and Ryan Pyle take off from Shanghai on their two well-kitted out BMW bikes for an epic adventure. They will cover 18,000 kilometres over 60 days in a circuit of China that has never been attempted before. Within minutes of setting off, Colin is nearly clipped by a giant bus and that's just the first in a series of unexpected obstacles that lie in wait for the Pyle duo. Crazy drivers, 40 degree plus heat, massive landslides, floods, inhospitable towns and dangerous falls will hamper their progress as they wind north from Shanghai, cross the Yangtze River and on to the border of China and the hermit kingdom of North Korea.\r\n\r\n2)  Inner Mongolia to Xinjiang Province \r\nRyan and Colin Pyle bike to Inner Mongolia, bunking down for a night in a yurt village before visiting one of China's largest wind farms. Heading away from the idyllic grassland and rolling green hills they strike the world's largest traffic jam, where some trucks are stuck for 20 days. Forging slowly forward the Pyle brothers hit a nasty sand storm in Xinjiang province, before striking camp at the lowest landsite in China, 150 meters below sea level.\r\n\r\n3)  Chinas Wild West \r\nRyan and Colin Pyle leave their moon-scape camping ground at Turpan and head across the salt flats to Xinjiang, China's Wild West. In a few hours they travel from 150m below sea level to 3300m above sea level in freezing temperatures. In the ancient Muslim city of Kashgar, they celebrate the end of Ramadan before venturing into the far western borderlands riding on the Karakoram Highway, the world's highest border crossing at 5200m above sea level, towards the border of China and Pakistan. However, at this point disaster strikes when Ryan takes a serious fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3173 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 520 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2524222/?ref_=tt_ov_inf \nhttp://www.toughrides.tv/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f59a59858d160083323abb7cf91f1107f21f9b","amp;dn":"Tough+Rides+China+Series+1+3of6+Chinas+Wild+West+720p+x264+AAC+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f59a59858d160083323abb7cf91f1107f21f9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,245,154,89,133,141,22,0,131,50,58,187,124,249,31,17,7,242,31,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
