Life at 1 is the first installment in a landmark series that aims to unlock the secrets of child development by following 11 babies and their families for seven years. We witness the factors that impact their lives, watch the interplay of nature and nurture, and talk to experts to find out what limits children's growth and wellbeing and what makes them thrive.
