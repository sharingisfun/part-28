Jude's boyhood friend Jonny comes to Jude with an idea he wants to pitch to Ray; Jude is reluctant to mix friendship with business (and family), but he does arrange a meeting. Ray takes Jonny on (he uses his job as a courier to steal credit cards), but Jonny soon finds himself bored: the gang is more interested in goofing around and planning Ray's wedding than in fighting, havoc, and mayhem. Jonny wants violence, so he repeatedly tries to start trouble with the South London equivalent of Ray's gang. Will he succeed? If he does, will he find glory in war?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199727/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199727/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888b5180bf5f8a0398c452cdd210630430d5cf76","amp;dn":"Love.Honor.and.Obey%5B2000%5DDvDrip.AC3%5BEng%5D-BONE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888b5180bf5f8a0398c452cdd210630430d5cf76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,139,81,128,191,95,138,3,152,196,82,205,210,16,99,4,48,213,207,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
