I would have uploaded this\n\ntorrent in FLAC or WAV but my computer doesn't currently have a functional optical \n\ndrive.  I ripped these files off the original soundtrack CD using a PS3 and then \n\ntransferred the files to my computer via USB flash drive.  Richard Band composed this\n\nmusic for the film &quot;Ghoulies&quot;, directed by Luca Bercovici, which was very successful \n\nin its day, grossing over $35,000,000 on a $1,000,000 budget.  The soundtrack was \n\nreleased by Intrada records along with Band's score for the film &quot;Re-Animator.&quot;  This \n\nlimited release is limited to only 1000 copies so it is definitely a rare item.\n\nRichard Band's score for this film is quite good and it has been beautifully \n\npreserved.  The soundtrack is mixed in stereo with great separation and the fidelity\n\nis fantastic.  These tracks, as far as I know, are the only ones specifically \n\ncomposed for the film.  The rest of the music heard in &quot;Ghoulies&quot; is borrowed from\n\nsome of Band's other soundtracks, &quot;Parasite&quot; and &quot;The Alchemist.&quot;  There were also\n\na couple of tracks by an artist named Fela Johnson used in &quot;Ghoulies&quot; during the\n\nparty scene.  I hope you enjoy this music as much as I do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d1c84dd1dc5931ac9b3932d2bcf05d95d59751a","amp;dn":"Ghoulies+Soundtrack+%28Richard+Band%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d1c84dd1dc5931ac9b3932d2bcf05d95d59751a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,28,132,221,29,197,147,26,201,179,147,45,43,207,5,217,93,89,117,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
