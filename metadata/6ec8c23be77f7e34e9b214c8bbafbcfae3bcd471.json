The filmmakers follow labour  rights lawyers Daniel Kovalik and Terry Collingsworth and an activist for  the Stop Killer-Coke! campaign, Ray Rogers, as they attempt to hold the  giant U.S. multinational beverage company accountable in this legal and  human rights battle.\n\n    Listed below are union leaders at Coca-Cola's Colombian bottling plants who  have been murdered. Hundreds of other Coke workers have been tortured,  kidnapped and/or illegally detained by violent paramilitaries, often  working closely with plant managements.\n\n    Date        Name \t                        Coca-Cola Plant\n    ----        ----                            ---------------\n    1990        Avelino Achicanoy \t            Pasto\n    4/8/94 \t    Jose Elaseasar MancoDavid \t    Carepa\n    4/20/94 \tLuis Enrique Giraldo Arango \tCarepa\n    4/23/95 \tLuis Enrique Gomez Garado \t    Carepa\n    12/5/96 \tIsidro Segundo Gil \t            Carepa\n    12/26/96 \tJose Librado Herrera Osorio     Carepa\n    6/21/2001 \tOscar Dario Soto Polo \t        Monteria\n    8/31/2002 \tAdolfo de Jesus Munera Lopez \tBaranquilla\n\nNotes:\n\n    This film has been transcoded from non-free formats to free container,  video, and audio codecs due to the serious nature of the inherent social  and ethical problems created through the use of proprietary software and  media formats.
