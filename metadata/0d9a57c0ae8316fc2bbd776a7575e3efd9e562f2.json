But even if there were, Containment: The Zombie Puzzler would be the best one. You don't match 3 of anything. There are no abstract objects that you have to put together. You surround zombies with 4 of the same unit, and destroy them. The zombies, not the units.\n\nDIFFERENT UNITS KILL ZOMBIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS\nActually, most of the time the zombies end up just getting shot. But they get shot in brutal ways by shotguns, M-16s, and handguns, depending on what type of unit you surround them with. If they still don't learn their lesson (and let's be honest, zombies usually don't learn lessons) a nice bonesaw might do the trick.\n\nNO, SERIOUSLY, IN REALLY DIFFERENT WAYS\nSurrounding zombies with cops gets you a sniper shot item. You can use this item to instantly take out a zombie. Prefer something less surgical? Then surround those undead jerks with soldiers, and you'll get a grenade. Want something MORE surgical? Then surround the shambling horde with doctors and you'll get a suit that resists infection.\n\nTHAT'S RIGHT, WE SAID INFECTION\nBut whatever you do to stop the zombie outbreak, you'd better do it fast. Every time you make a move, the zombies get closer to infecting nearby units. How can you even the odds? By using those items we mentioned a few sentences ago. You'll also drop giant objects from the sky, electrocute zombies with a lightning rod, and much, much more.\n\nOH, AND DON'T FORGET THE BOSS BATTLES\nThe zombies don't play fair. By themselves, the regular zombies are bad enough. But over the course of Containment: The Zombie Puzzler, you'll encounter a whole mess of different enemy types, including some killer boss fights. Only by using every trick in the book (along with new tricks that you'll discover in each stage) will you survive the zombie apocalypse.\n\nBUT WAIT, THEREÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S MORE\nLike an epic campaign mode with branching paths and over a hundred stages. Like a Survival Mode with that will challenge you to last through intense zombie fights.\n\nDONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT\nAll of this made GameCritics.com call our game Ã¢â‚¬Å“a brilliant new puzzlerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Gosh, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice of them. They said we had Ã¢â‚¬Å“really gone above and beyondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. We certainly tried, and we think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll agree. But then they also said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“truly unique puzzle games are few and far between, but Containment: The Zombie Puzzler caught [their] attention from the first time [they] laid eyes on it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Okay, now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re blushing.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Now available for lots and lots of Android phones!\n- Pressing the HOME button will bring up the pause screen after players return to the game.\n- Updates to the UI so the back button will go backwards in the Main Menu.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bootsnakegames.containmentgame&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bootsnakegames.containmentgame&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Install APK\n2.Copy 'com.bootsnakegames.containmentgame' folder to 'sdcard/Android/Obb'\n3.Launch the game\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9a57c0ae8316fc2bbd776a7575e3efd9e562f2","amp;dn":"Containment+The+Zombie+Puzzler+v1.4+%5BPD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9a57c0ae8316fc2bbd776a7575e3efd9e562f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,154,87,192,174,131,22,252,43,189,119,106,117,117,227,239,217,229,98,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
