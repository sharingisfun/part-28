Understanding the world is an entirely different problem from dealing with the world, and this section recommends attitudes that can be beneficial in a world where the veil has been lifted by the power of reason. In the end, it is found that false hopes are replaced by a newfound sense of realistic possibilities and a greater understanding of the human condition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a740835650175329400ac3fe31eb6dc06b96d9","amp;dn":"The+Path+of+Reason+-+A+Philosophy+of+Nonbelief","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a740835650175329400ac3fe31eb6dc06b96d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,167,64,131,86,80,23,83,41,64,10,195,254,49,235,109,192,107,150,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
