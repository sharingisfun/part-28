Others like Carl Perkins, Lonnie Mack, Tommey Tucker, The Kingsmen,\nRobert Parker and Ernie K-Doe, never hit a purple hit patch, but carried out\nrespectable musical careers, which in Carl Perkins&amp;#039; case holds until today.\nBut what about the other artists in this collection.\nArtists like Hank Mizell, Curtis Lee,Jewel Akens and Bob and Earl at least enjoyed their moment of hit-parade glory.\nTheir message inspired kids to go into the record store in droves to purchase their hit\nsingles and bringing immense joy to a large amount of kids at a given time. This is\nmore than can be said of most of us. (From Liner Notes).\n\n\n01. Carl Perkins - Blue Suede Shoes                              \n02.
