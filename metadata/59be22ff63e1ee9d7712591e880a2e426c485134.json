Service robots such as cleaning machines and inspection or assistance robots will bring us great support in our daily lives. This textbook provides an introduction to the methods of controlling these robotic systems. Starting from mobile robot kinematics, the reader receives a systematic overview of the basic problems as well as methods and algorithms used for solving them. Localization, object recognition, map building, navigation, and control architectures for autonomous vehicles will be discussed in detail. A survey of specific service robot applications is also included. This book is a useful introduction to mobile robotics for beginners as well as advanced students and engineers.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 283 pages\n    * Publisher: Vieweg and Teubner (October 1, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3834804215\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3834804211","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59be22ff63e1ee9d7712591e880a2e426c485134","amp;dn":"Autonomous+Land+Vehicles%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59be22ff63e1ee9d7712591e880a2e426c485134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,190,34,255,99,225,238,157,119,18,89,30,136,10,46,66,108,72,81,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
