When I tell people that I liked this movie, they gasp, thinking I've lost my mind. But, I haven't. If you go back in time and watch the Beatles' movie &quot;Help!&quot;, you will find similar gags and stupidities. This movie is enjoyable, harmless, and full of good music. I find their song covers to be quite refreshing. The kept all of the familiar elements of the songs while modernizing them. After watching this movie I downloaded the soundtrack. They do just as well as the cast of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. Nobody will ever be as good as The Beatles, even BTR admitted this. I applaud Big Time Rush for doing what most do not dare try.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907129f988033490b1a795f36176db4693ff2d69","amp;dn":"Big+Time+Movie+2012+WEB-DL+XviD+-+S4A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907129f988033490b1a795f36176db4693ff2d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,113,41,249,136,3,52,144,177,167,149,243,97,118,219,70,147,255,45,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
