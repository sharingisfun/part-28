Readers couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough of its heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offbeat combination of academic degrees, tai chi skills, and nose for danger. When the second adventure, WidowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TwoStep, was published, it quickly earned an Edgar Award. Instead of accepting a teaching position at the university, Tres is finishing up his apprenticeship for a private investigatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing a poor job of surveillance on the fiddle player in a promising honkytonk band: she is shot in broad daylight while he watches. Shaken, Tres begins an investigation on his own. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not long before he discovers that some people will do anything to capture a lucrative recording contract. With suspense as sizzling as the southwestern sun, and a truly colorful cast of characters, The WidowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TwoStep is a hit with mystery lovers well beyond the Lone Star State. Narrator Tom StechschulteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance adds just the right spice to TresÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ character.\n\nCrack another case with Tres Navarre. \n\n\n\nConverted using SoundTaxi - MP3 compression quality 170 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260d8507f4d7eba35eca44ec01d281d51646c76f","amp;dn":"Rick+Riordan+Widowers+Two-Step+-+Tres+Navarre+Mystery+Book+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260d8507f4d7eba35eca44ec01d281d51646c76f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,13,133,7,244,215,235,163,94,202,68,236,1,210,129,213,22,70,199,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
