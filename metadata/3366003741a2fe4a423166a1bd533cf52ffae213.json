They return to their true calling in life. This is that release.....a return to who Huey and the News really are. Below there's a review by some teenager who was caught up in the grunge and metal. Cool kid...although that review was like 10 years ago, check it out,.\n\nThis is the only torrent of this CD so grab it and don't let go.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\nimage\n\nBy Christian \nI love SPORTS, but you can't beat HARD AT PLAY... I found this sitting on the shelf at a local used CD store, so I decided to pick it up since Sam Goody had informed me that it has been long out of print. Anyway, this is an incredible album, and I'm only 16 and not a big fan of this genre, I like metal, rock and grunge... my favorite bands are Puddle of Mudd, Nirvana, Socialburn, Staind, Godsmack, Pantera, Bleeding Through, etc... and still this album catches my attention!!\nROCK ON, HUEY BUDDY!!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nHuey Lewis &amp; the News - Hard at Play\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Huey Lewis &amp; the News\nAlbum................: Hard at Play\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
