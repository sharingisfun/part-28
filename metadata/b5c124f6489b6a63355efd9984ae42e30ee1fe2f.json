Based on three years of work by some thirty five researchers, Media Piracy in Emerging Economies tells two overarching stories: one tracing the explosive growth of piracy as digital technologies became cheap and ubiquitous around the world, and another following the growth of industry lobbies that have reshaped laws and law enforcement around copyright protection. The report argues that these efforts have largely failed, and that the problem of piracy is better conceived as a failure of affordable access to media in legal markets. \n\n# Hardcover: 436 pages\n# Publisher: SSRC Books; First edition (2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0984125744\n# ISBN-13: 978-0984125746","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c124f6489b6a63355efd9984ae42e30ee1fe2f","amp;dn":"Media+Piracy+in+Emerging+Economies+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c124f6489b6a63355efd9984ae42e30ee1fe2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,193,36,246,72,155,106,99,53,94,253,153,132,174,66,227,14,225,254,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
