Bartok's Six String Quartets were written in the 30 years between 1909 and 1939. The Takacs Quartet's recordings of these pieces, released by Decca in 1998, are the most magnificent of which I am aware.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f67917348f6364b51a045d27abcd4833f93a615","amp;dn":"Bartok+-+The+String+Quartets+-+Tak%26aacute%3Bcs+Quartet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f67917348f6364b51a045d27abcd4833f93a615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,103,145,115,72,246,54,75,81,160,69,210,122,188,212,131,63,147,166,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
