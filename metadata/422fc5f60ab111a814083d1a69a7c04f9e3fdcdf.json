After graduating from the California School of Culinary Arts, Randy went on to dabble in restaurant kitchens, intern at dairy farms and wineries, and generally drift around in the food business. Eventually, he came to realize his passion for food was no longer something he could keep to himself, and he began to put his pen to paper.\nStarting with writing restaurant reviews for a small, local newspaper, Randy soon began an internship at Los Angeles magazine. He would also go on to write for publications such as Gourmet, Saveur, Draft, Imbibe, Wine Enthusiast, and BeerAdvocate.\nHis love affair with Sriracha began around 1999, with a simple drizzle over a bowl of fried rice. It was only a matter of time before he began experimenting with the addictive hot sauce in his kitchen. During a Sriracha-and-pho-induced endorphin rush, an idea for a cookbook popped into his head.\nRandy currently lives in San Diego, CA and believes strongly in eating local, sustainably-grown food. He is a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals and the Culinary Historians of Southern California. Randy is a BJCP Recognized Beer Judge and is a strong supporter of the amazingly talented Southern California craft breweries. He is also the co-author of &quot;The Craft of Stone Brewing Co.: Liquid Lore, Epic Recipes, and Unabashed Arrogance.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422fc5f60ab111a814083d1a69a7c04f9e3fdcdf","amp;dn":"The+Sriracha+Cookbook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422fc5f60ab111a814083d1a69a7c04f9e3fdcdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,47,197,246,10,177,17,168,20,8,61,26,105,167,192,79,158,63,220,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
