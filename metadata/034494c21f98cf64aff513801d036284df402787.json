Nor do i wish to be him. I am simply making this killer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;book\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; more accessible for those who cant open .pdf files. \nIn no way do i condone and agree with the killers ideas. \nI claim no ownership of any content.\n\n\nThe .txt file does not contain any pictures. The .doc and .docx have the pictures.\n\nNote of distribution from Anders himself.\n\nEDIT: added .xps format.\n\n\nDistribution of the book\nThe content of the compendium truly belongs to everyone and is free to be distributed in\nany way or form. In fact, I ask only one favour of you; I ask that you distribute this book\nto everyone you know. Please do not think that others will take care of it. Sorry to be\nblunt, but it does not work out that way. If we, the Western European Resistance, fail or\nbecome apathetic, then Western Europe will fall, and your freedom and our children\nfreedom with itÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âª It is essential and very important that everyone is at least presented\nwith the truth before our systems come crashing down within 2 to 7 decades. So again, I\nhumbly ask you to re-distribute the book to as many patriotic minded individuals as you\ncan. I am 100% certain that the distribution of this compendium to a large portion of\nEuropean patriots will contribute to ensure our victory in the end. Because within these\nthree books lies the tools required to win the ongoing Western European cultural war.\nAs already mentioned; the compendium is a compilation of works from multiple\ncourageous individuals throughout the world. I have spent more than three years writing\nand/or compiling most of the content. None of the other authors have been asked to\nparticipate in this project due to practical and security reasons but most of them have\nmade their material available for distribution. The needs of the many outweigh the needs\nof the few. This is the reason why I have decided to allow the content of this\ncompendium to be freely redistributed and translated. Consider it my personal gift and\ncontribution to all Europeans. The sources are not embedded into the document for this\nreason (easier to use and distribute the various articles). However, it is required that the\nauthor(s) are credited when the material is used.\nAs such, the intellectual property of this compendium belongs to all Europeans across the\nEuropean world and can be distributed and translated without limitations. Efficient\ndistribution and circulation will be possible if those who agree with at least some of its\ncontent, principles or ideas contribute to spread the information. If you are reading this\nyou will know that many people will be interested in obtaining the compendium (3\nbooks). LetÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s use this momentum to our advantage as it will surely benefit our struggle.\nIÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³m depending on you to distribute the book or some/all of its content to as many\npatriotic European political activists as possible. Let them know what is going on and\nwhat is required of each and every one of us. After all, we do not only have a right to\nresist the current development, it is our duty as Europeans to prevent the annihilation of\nour identities, our cultures and traditions and our nation states! Please contribute to\ndistribute the compendium to as many patriotic minded Europeans as humanly possible\nin all 26 European countries.
