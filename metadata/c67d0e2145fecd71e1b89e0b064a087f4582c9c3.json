Now, based on the 2010 film, is a terrifying new novel written by Jonathan Maberry, based on the screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self based on a motion picture screenplay by Curt Siodmak.\n\nLawrence Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector has come to investigate.\n\nAs Talbot pieces together the gory puzzle, he hears of an ancient curse that turns the afflicted into werewolves when the moon is full. Now, if he has any chance at ending the slaughter and protecting the woman he has grown to love, Talbot must destroy the vicious creature that stalks the woods surrounding Blackmoor. But as he hunts for the nightmarish beast, a simple man with a tortured past will uncover a primal side to himself . . . one he never imagined existed.\n\nLENGTH: 9 hrs and 29 mins\nUNABRIDGED\nNarrated by Fred Berman \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n\n--------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67d0e2145fecd71e1b89e0b064a087f4582c9c3","amp;dn":"The+Wolfman+-+Jonathan+Maberry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67d0e2145fecd71e1b89e0b064a087f4582c9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,125,14,33,69,254,205,113,225,184,158,11,6,74,8,127,69,130,201,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
