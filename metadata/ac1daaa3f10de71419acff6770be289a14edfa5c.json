This was aired as the 2 parter Season 7 finale. \n\nThis is the EXTENDED CUT of that. It has five minutes EXTRA all on the Epic Finale. \nIt incorporates the Extended scenes from Season 9 premierre plus some more. \nSome minor alterations were made to have the scenes fit in a fast paced but cohesive form. \n\nYES... it is FAN MADE. I never uploaded my FAN EDITS &amp;#039;cause I didn&amp;#039;t think anyone would be interested but since my friends loved it and kept bugging me, here it is. \n\nFor those who HAVE seen it... you can give it a try or not. BUT for those who have NOT, I would recommend watching this one &amp;#039;cause these scenes were not put in the original one &amp;#039;cause of production costs. \n\nQUALITY: - DVDRIP FULL RES \n\nVIDEO - 720 x 576 [16:9 Codec Aspect Ratio] \nCODEC - XVID \nFRAME - 30 FPS \nAUDIO - 160 KBps LAME MP3 \n\nLENGTH - 1:24:32 [1 Hour 24 Minutes 32 Seconds] \n\nP.S. - If you would like me to upload the other Fan Edits... just let me know on the comment section. \nAll comments are appreciated. \n\nEnjoy. :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1daaa3f10de71419acff6770be289a14edfa5c","amp;dn":"Stargate.SG1.Lost.City.Extended.Cut.S07E21.DVDRIP.Bapman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1daaa3f10de71419acff6770be289a14edfa5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,29,170,163,241,13,231,20,25,172,255,103,112,190,40,154,20,237,250,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
