Tended to recovery by their keeper Montgomery, Prendick soon finds himself stranded upon an uncharted island with his rescuer and the beasts. Here, he meets the sinister Dr. Moreau Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a brilliant scientist whose experiments in vivisection have caused him to abandon the civilised world. It soon becomes clear he has been continuing the experiments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with horrific results!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73635a828bd242e6ed11a5bbd7549f482efd71c","amp;dn":"The+Island+of+Dr.+Moreau+-+H.G.Wells+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73635a828bd242e6ed11a5bbd7549f482efd71c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,54,53,168,40,189,36,46,110,209,26,91,189,117,73,244,130,239,215,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
