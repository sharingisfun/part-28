Desperate times sometimes require desperate measures, and Evvie took them - measures that shamed her and threatened Edgar's love. \n\nBut during the war years of sacrifice and separation they learned that their love could surmount anything - even Evvie's shameful past.\nAfter sixty-five years, they share their shocking story for the first time. Will it be enough to save Bram and Sarah's marriage?\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69bee4e2716f1c39f8f80eeef006ef590811947f","amp;dn":"Upstairs+at+Miss+Hattie%27s+by+Ken+Casper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69bee4e2716f1c39f8f80eeef006ef590811947f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,190,228,226,113,111,28,57,248,248,14,238,240,6,239,89,8,17,148,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
