His work has always been very good and\nhis style is in my opinion one of the best on the web\nor out of it. Then all of a sudden he was gone, poof.\nNo where to be found, but I did. He has now started\nhis very own site and changed his name to Basil (for\nresons that are his own) and is continuing his quest\nto give us amazing artwork.&quot; - a quote from http://kein.alliances.org/\n\nI, as well used to visit Basil's site and just recently went searching for him and can't seem to find hide nor hair of him or his alter ego, Fritzz. I'd be very interested to know what happened to him.\n\nIt just so happens that when I used to go to his site, I collected as much of his work as I could, and so, I am sharing that with you. I hope you all enjoy it, because Basil/ Fritzz was or is an amazing talent that I can only aspire to right now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dd065c7f5962f0f852dca041bd3d0baed08ef03","amp;dn":"basiltoons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dd065c7f5962f0f852dca041bd3d0baed08ef03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,208,101,199,245,150,47,15,133,45,202,4,27,211,208,186,237,8,239,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
