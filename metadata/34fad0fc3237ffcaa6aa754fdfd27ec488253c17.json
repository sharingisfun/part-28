R. Baughman and Y. A. Liu (AP, 1995).pdf\r\n\r\nNeural networks have received a great deal of attention among scientists and engineers. In chemical engineering, neural computing has moved from pioneering projects toward mainstream industrial applications. This book introduces the fundamental principles of neural computing, and is the first to focus on its practical applications in bioprocessing and chemical engineering. Examples, problems, and 10 detailed case studies demonstrate how to develop, train, and apply neural networks. A disk containing input data files for all illustrative examples, case studies, and practice problems provides the opportunity for hands-on experience. An important goal of the book is to help the student or practitioner learn and implement neural networks quickly and inexpensively using commercially available, PC-based software tools. Detailed network specifications and training procedures are included for all neural network examples discussed in the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34fad0fc3237ffcaa6aa754fdfd27ec488253c17","amp;dn":"Neural+Networks+in+Bioprocessing+and+Chemical+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34fad0fc3237ffcaa6aa754fdfd27ec488253c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,250,208,252,50,55,255,202,166,170,117,79,223,210,126,196,136,37,60,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
