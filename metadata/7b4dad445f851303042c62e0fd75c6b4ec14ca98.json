As Gertrude grows up into an attractive young woman the pastor, now middle-aged, realises that he is in love with her. To his chagrin, his adopted son, Jean, is also in love with Gertrude, even though he is shortly to be married to another woman. JeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiancÃƒÂ©e is jealous of Gertrude and arranges for her to see a doctor in the hope that she might be cured and to enable Jean to choose equally between the two women. Miraculously, GertrudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sight is restored and she returns to the village a changed woman. Unable to accept JeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love and disappointed by the pastorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affections for her, she realises that her former happiness has been lost forever\n\nRip Specs\nFile Name ................................................: La.symphonie.pastorale.1946.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..................................: 1 502 044 160 bytes\nRuntime ...................................................: 01:42:41\n\nVideo Codec ...........................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ..............................................: 640 x 480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .........................................................: 25.000 fps\nVideo Bitrate ...........................................: 1748 Kbps\nBits per Pixel ...........................................: 0.228 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC .....................: [N-VOP], [P-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...........................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ............................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...........................................: 192 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams ..............................: 1\n\n+ Extras\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039004&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio, English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nRipped and posted at KG by Weimar, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4dad445f851303042c62e0fd75c6b4ec14ca98","amp;dn":"Jean+Delannoy+-++La+symphonie+pastorale+%281946%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b4dad445f851303042c62e0fd75c6b4ec14ca98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,77,173,68,95,133,19,3,4,44,98,224,253,117,198,180,236,20,202,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
