Originally known as Hocus Pocus, the group, which took the name UFO in honor of a London club, debuted in 1971 with UFO 1. Both the album and its follow-up, the same year's Flying, found great success in Japan, France, and Germany, but went barely noticed in the band's native country; as a result, their third effort, 1972's Live, was released only in Japan. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tSteamhammer\nCatalog:\t\tSPV 309259\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Fight Night\n02.Wonderland\n03.Mojo Town\n04.Angel Station\n05.Year Of The Gun\n06.The Last Stone Rider\n07.Steal Yourself\n08.Burn Your House Down\n09.The Fear\n10.Waving Good Bye\n11.Other Men's Wives [Bonus Track]\n12.Bag O' Blues [Bonus Track]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9de7635588032acc11d6e8311d3b643da7134a","amp;dn":"UFO+-+Seven+Deadly+%5BLimited+Ed.%5D+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9de7635588032acc11d6e8311d3b643da7134a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,157,231,99,85,136,3,42,204,17,214,232,49,29,59,100,61,167,19,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
