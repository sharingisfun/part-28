During my initial research, I found an interesting Garlock related story, but was unable to find much of a bio that would be of any real interest. I guess it is best to just let Garlock speak for himself, and on this record he does plenty of that.\nThis guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance is Oscar material. In the lecture on this record he claims to have listened to and analysed more than 2000 rock songs in a single week. So letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s say the average rock song at the time was 2 minutes and 30 seconds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 5000 minutes, or 3.5 days of continuous music listening. He would have to spend 14 hours per day for 6 days (I assume he spends his entire Sunday in holy worship) just to listen to the music. Even if his analysis took a mere 30 seconds per song, that would still add another 3 hours to his 14-hour work day. A 17-hour work day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without breaks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just to deconstruct rock and roll music? Now that is dedication. Tell me Frank, if rock and roll is so dangerous, and you have listened to so much of it, how come you are not deranged like the rest of us?\n\nBelieve it or not, this guy Garlock has been at it for the last 30 years, as founder of Majesty Music. His more recent sermons answer questions like: What Kind of Music Does God Want Us to Have?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6182d36c880c3848f6294b9dd15cfc543f441b","amp;dn":"The+Big+Beat%3A+A+Rock+Blast+-+1971+%28Why+rock+is+evil%29+-+3000+copi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6182d36c880c3848f6294b9dd15cfc543f441b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,97,130,211,108,136,12,56,72,246,41,75,157,209,92,252,84,63,68,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
