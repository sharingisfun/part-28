But her ultimate quest to restore Earth's magic is flailing . . . Her search is pulling her one way, her companion another, and a newly encountered society of witches has a completely different idea for the future of Willow.\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f761c2c1ba5520d81440d5159a02b6be62f295ba","amp;dn":"Willow+03+%282+Covers+1440px%2B2048px%29+%28Tarutaru-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f761c2c1ba5520d81440d5159a02b6be62f295ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,97,194,193,186,85,32,216,20,64,213,21,154,2,182,190,98,242,149,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
