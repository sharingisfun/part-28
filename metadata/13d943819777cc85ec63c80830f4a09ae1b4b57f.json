Live 93 is a collection of highlights from The Orb's 1993 performances in Europe and Asia. It features The Orb's live performance crew of Alex Paterson, Kris Weston, producers Nick Burton and Simon Phillips, as well as audio engineer Andy Hughes, who had stepped in when Weston decided to stop touring.[2] The album cover with the sheep over the Battersea Power Station is a parody of the cover of Pink Floyd's Animals, an album cover they had previously parodied on the cover of Aubrey Mixes: The Ultraworld Excursions. [3] The album reached #23 on the UK Album Chart. Alex Patterson has noted that Orb Live 93 read backwards is 39 Evil Bro (as seen on the back cover of the album), apparently a reference to Hitler and the start of World War II in 1939.\n\n\n\n\nDisc one\n&quot;Plateau&quot; (Fehlmann/Weston/Paterson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:52\n&quot;O.
