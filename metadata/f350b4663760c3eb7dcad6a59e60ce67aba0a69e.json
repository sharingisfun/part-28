Includes assessment methods, depending on the level of stress (stress-life), the deformation and the method of Dang Van.\n\nFeatures a standard package DesignLife:\n\nAnalysis of fatigue life, depending on the level of stress (Stress Life)\nAnalysis of the fatigue life design depending on the level of stress. It is possible to interpolate between the curves of the material properties depending on temperature. You can use Python scripts to create new or improve existing methods for assessing the fatigue life. The preliminary decision cycle fatigue curves with control of nominal voltage.\n\nMaterial models:\n\nStandard SN.\nSN Mean multi-curve.\nSN R-ratio multi-curve.\nSN Haigh multi-curve.\nSN Temperature multi-curve.\nBastenaire SN.\n\nTypical model SN-based scripting Python.\nAnalysis of the fatigue life depending on the strain (Strain Life)\nThe possibility of predicting fatigue life based on an analysis of local deformations in the structure. The possibility of interpolating between the curves of the material properties depending on temperature. Suitable for a wide range of problems including low-cycle fatigue with the control of elastic-plastic deformations.\n\nMaterial models:\n\nStandard EN.\nEN Mean multi-curve.\nEN R-ratio multi-curve.\nEN Temperature multi-curve.\nCorrection of secondary stress in the cycle:\nMorrow.\nSmith Watson Topper.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nIt can be installed as a standalone (Stand Alone) and integrated into the established ANSYS v12-v13\n\nSystem Requirements:\n 1GB + RAM\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f350b4663760c3eb7dcad6a59e60ce67aba0a69e","amp;dn":"Ansys_13.0_nCode_DesignLife_SP1_v.13.0_x32_x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f350b4663760c3eb7dcad6a59e60ce67aba0a69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,80,180,102,55,96,195,235,125,202,214,165,158,96,206,103,171,160,166,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
