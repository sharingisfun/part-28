Cardiff head to London in search of their first win at White Hart Lane since 1954. The newly-promoted Bluebirds controversially changed their manager earlier this season, with owner Vincent Tan deciding Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had a better chance of keeping the club up than predecessor Malky Mackay. Tottenham also opted for a change at the top, with Tim Sherwood replacing Andre Villas-Boas in December. Mark and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's matches.\n\nNotes\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps, which gives much more fluid and smoother movement.
