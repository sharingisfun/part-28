The Hollies became one of the leading British groups of the 1960s (231 weeks on the UK singles charts during the 1960s; the 9th highest of any artist of the decade) and into the mid 1970s. They are one of the few British pop groups of the early 1960s that have never officially broken up and continue to record and perform. In recognition of their achievements, the Hollies were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay with The Hollies is the first album released by The Hollies. The album was released in the United Kingdom on the Parlophone label, owned by EMI, in January 1964. In Canada an album with the same title was released on the Capitol 6000 label, also owned by EMI, in July 1964 with a completely different track listing. In the US, Imperial Records released yet another version of this LP under the title Here I Go Again in June 1964\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb77a034a9f35c4d9e78c579d1f600f5302d1f0b","amp;dn":"The+Hollies+-+Stay+With+The+Hollies+%282013%29+Japan+Mini+LP+SHM-CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb77a034a9f35c4d9e78c579d1f600f5302d1f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,119,160,52,169,243,92,77,158,120,197,121,209,246,0,245,48,45,31,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
