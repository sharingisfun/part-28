R. Martin, is that the majority of the DC Universe's supervillains -- both major ones and newer or more obscure ones have been captured by the Suicide Squad and imprisoned on a distant planet. The story features the villains splitting into alliances and trying to find a way to escape their prison, or choose to rule the planet &quot;Salvation&quot; on which they have landed. Bill Willingham (Fables) started as writer, but had to hand the project over to Matthew Sturges (Shadowpact , Blue Beetle) after only three issues because of illness. \n\nMajor characters in the mini-series include Superman's archenemy Lex Luthor, Batman's archenemy the Joker, the &quot;Rogues&quot; who typically battle the Flash (Heat Wave, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Abra Kadabra and Mirror Master), and other morally ambiguous heroes such as Vandal Savage's daughter Scandal and Batman's occasional lover Catwoman. Tie-ins to the series have occurred in Countdown to Final Crisis (which details Piper and Trickster's continual evasion of capture), Gotham Underground, Outsiders, Checkmate, Catwoman, and Justice League of America.\n\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06261f23aae01b22a3536aaf7d67147013cb5a3","amp;dn":"Salvation+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06261f23aae01b22a3536aaf7d67147013cb5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,98,97,242,58,174,1,178,42,53,54,170,247,214,113,71,1,60,181,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
