If your extracted files are on C:English.7106.x86, when you are on repair command prompt, then you can simply use 1stcopyme.cmd. If they are not and they are for example on D:English.7106.x86, then you need to manualy copy with xcopy, command is &quot;xcopy * D: /S&quot;\n\nNow reboot in to windows, it will still be in chinese, so you run &quot;2ndrunmeasadmin.cmd&quot; as admin doh and apply English.reg in to registry. Reboot and you have 7106 in english ;)\n\nthanks to Viper_zzz for method.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d262afdcad198e5f25dc5001d0c6fca277528b8a","amp;dn":"Windows+7+build+7106+_x86_+English+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d262afdcad198e5f25dc5001d0c6fca277528b8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,98,175,220,173,25,142,95,37,220,80,1,208,198,252,162,119,82,139,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
