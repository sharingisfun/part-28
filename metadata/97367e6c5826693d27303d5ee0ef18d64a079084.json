My name is Casey Kasem. The countdown rolls on now with Leon Russell at number nineteen and 'Lady Blue.'&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nGlen Campbell passes Elton John for most weeks in the top 40 for 1975. Elton kept &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; on the chart for seventeen weeks. This is the eighteenth week for &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy.&quot;\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;During the rock era, have two versions of one song ever appeared on the chart at the same time, and both hit number one?&quot; Casey says no, but tells about the time in 1957 when two versions of the same song hit numbers one and two.\n\nCasey tells us whatever happened to Timi Yuro.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What song stayed in the top ten for the most weeks?&quot; The song that holds the record was by a vocal group whose first hit was back in 1929!\n\nThere is a group in the countdown that was able to make $850,000 per year on the road even when disputes with their recording label kept them from putting out any new records for four years.\n\nAnother listener wants to know, &quot;Who is the top album artist who has never had a hit single?&quot; The answer is a fellow who has had a hit television show, now in syndication, and put twelve albums on the album chart without ever making the singles chart.\n\n40: The Agony And The Ecstasy - Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles\n39: Just Too Many People - Melissa Manchester\n38: Nights On Broadway - The Bee Gees\n37: Wasted Days And Wasted Nights - Freddie Fender\n36: Island Girl - Elton John\n35: There Goes Another Love Song - The Outlaws\n34: Sweet Sticky Thing - The Ohio Players\n33: Blue Eyes Cryin' In The Rain - Willie Nelson\n32: Run Joey Run - David Geddes\n31: Sky High - Jigsaw\n30: Rockin' All Over The World - John Fogerty\n29: I Only Have Eyes For You - Art Garfunkel\n28: Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen\n27: Rhinestone Cowboy - Glen Campbell\n26: What A Difference A Day Makes - Esther Phillips\n25: You - George Harrison\n24: S.O.S. - ABBA\n23: Low-Rider - War\n22: Carolina In The Pines - Michael Murphy\n21: The Way That I Want To Touch You - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n20: This Will Be - Natalie Cole\n19: Lady Blue - Leon Russell\n18: Do It Any Way You Wanna - People's Choice\n17: Something Better To Do - Olivia Newton-John\n16: Mr. Jaws - Dickie Goodman\n15: Rocky - Austin Roberts\n14: Heatwave - Linda Ronstadt\n13: Brazil - The Richie Family\n12: Fame - David Bowie\n11: It Only Takes A Minute - Tavares\n10: Who Loves You - The Four Seasons\n9: Games People Play - Spinners\n8: Ain't No Way To Treat A Lady - Helen Reddy\n7: Feelings - Morris Alpert\n6: Dance With Me - Orleans\n5: Ballroom Blitz - Sweet\n4: Lying Eyes - The Eagles\n3: Miracles - The Jefferson Starship\n2: Calypso - John Denver\n1: Bad Blood - Neil Sedaka\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97367e6c5826693d27303d5ee0ef18d64a079084","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1975_October_18th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97367e6c5826693d27303d5ee0ef18d64a079084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,54,126,108,88,38,105,61,39,48,61,94,224,239,24,214,74,7,144,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
