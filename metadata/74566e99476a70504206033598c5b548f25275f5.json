Her grandfather, Harry Simeone, was a successful pianist and composer whose works included &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; and &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot;. His wife, Margaret McCravy was a singer for the jazz bandleader Benny Goodman. After leaving home for college, Stevenson began both playing guitar and writing songs.\nGrowing up in Rockville Centre, Stevenson befriended members of The Arrogant Sons of Bitches. After they disbanded in 2005, she was appointed keyboard player for the lead singer Jeff Rosenstock's new project, Bomb The Music Industry!. At this point, she had written a number of songs and was performing solo. While recording and touring with Bomb The Music Industry!, she began to piece together her own band, which was named Laura Stevenson &amp; the Cans.\nInitially, Stevenson's band consisted primarily of members of Bomb The Music Industry!. In summer 2007, Stevenson recruited Michael Campbell of the Long Island punk band Latterman to play bass guitar for The Cans. Alex Billig was added on trumpet later that fall, and a year later Stevenson began working on her first studio recording.\nAsian Man Records released &quot;A Record&quot; on April 13, 2010, on LP and CD. The group spent more than half of that year on tour in The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Western Europe in various line-ups: sometimes as small as just Stevenson and Campbell on acoustic guitars, and other times fully electric with a three-piece horn section. The group toured with Bomb The Music Industry!, Maps &amp; Atlases, Cults, and Cheap Girls.\nThe band officially signed to the New Jersey independent label Don Giovanni Records in November 2010, and their second album, Sit Resist, was released on April 26, 2011.\nStevenson's third full length album, Wheel, was released on April 23, 2013, on Don Giovanni Records. Pitchfork Media had previously premiered the first single from the album, &quot;Runner&quot;.[4] Stevenson toured the U.S. in April and May in support of the album along with another New York band, Field Mouse.\n\nReview:\nOn punk-turned-country-leaning chronicler Laura StevensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album, 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s A Record, she was frank about her tendency to obscure her feelings. The precious, old-timey piano waltz of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beets UnitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ found her intoning, in her sweet vinegar voice, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I need to stop singing in code/ To start ringing true because true rings only.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken her until her third LP-- the second for Don Giovanni-- to feel sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reached that point. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also dropped Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and the Cans from her stage name (though they remain her backing band) and decided to deal with her demons: the realization that death is inevitable, and the ensuing battle between succumbing to futility, self-destruction, or balancing somewhere between the two. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There comes a time when you decide if you fight it off or learn to die,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings on Ã¢â‚¬Å“TriangleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, her snarl slight over her bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crunching, good-timey wallop. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heavy stuff, but you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t immediately know it just by listening to Wheel, which spins a line in folk-rock bonhomie so sincere that a few gnarled sticks thrown in its spokes wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go amiss.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01.
