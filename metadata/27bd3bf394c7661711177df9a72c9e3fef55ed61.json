This album is less folky than their debut. Although I enjoy the mesmerizing moments, I do not find the compositions too interesting to begin with. Not for proggers!\nAktuala are one of the original world music hybrids from Italy. First track mixes an Indian groove with harmonica, which isÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ weird. Next track has some free blow sax within a general Eastern acoustic setting. Violin dominates the 3rd piece. Last track is the best of the lot and, not surprisingly, sticks to an Indian raga trance. WouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve liked to have heard more fusion on the album overall, but still nice.\nThis album sometimes reminds me of such a &quot;Proto-Progressive&quot; band called Jade Warrior. &quot;La Terra&quot; contains four extended instrumental tracks, within a strange blend: that is a particular oriental music with Indian percussion, but also a mix from the Mediterranean and North African area, characterized -in some circumstances only- by some good breaks through concerning a blues stuff. Moreover you find some spare music excursions in the vein of the typical US jazz,like for instance that one by Miles Davis, even though their performances have got a diverse range of styles,like for example those ones by Shakti from the John McLoughlin's ensemble, or that one by Oregon, which is different from the typical Us jazz. They use some unplugged instruments and,despite of this remarkable material, I think that the tracks on &quot;La Terra&quot; are too much long! Nevertheless that's the unique defect of a memorable work. Besides Aktuala's music is less ambitious and sometimes also more accessible in comparison to the music by Shakti or Oregon-but this is not a problem for me (except on their soloing which can become tired at last)... but finally this instrumental ethnic progressive album is so creative that I forgive them, despite of its length and such an easier approach too, which is also more free than the fusion stuff by McLoughlin&amp;C!\nInteresting and finally a recommended album too, above all talking about the majority of their original tracks!!\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tecchio.net/img/covers/Aktuala_LaTerra.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tecchio.net/img/covers/Aktuala_LaTerra.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
