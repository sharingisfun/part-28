Their unique design Ã¢â‚¬â€œ built with a lower height than other North American locomotives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has made the series a common sight on the Northeast Corridor, known for its low-profile tunnels. \n\nThe P32 AC-DM can operate on power generated by diesel motor or from third rail pick-up. It is also unique in being equipped with General ElectricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alternating current (AC) traction motors, rather than DC motors as used in other subtypes. \n\nThe P32 AC-DM Ã¢â‚¬ËœGenesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Train Simulator is available in Metro-North livery and features in-cab signalling specifically for the NEC: New York-New Haven route. Also included are Metro-North Shoreliner III passenger cars and a Metro-North Shoreliner III Cabcar.
