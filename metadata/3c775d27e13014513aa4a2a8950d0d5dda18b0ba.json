The Fourth Edition of this best-selling book is packed full of information to help the reader move from a presenting problem to an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThis Fourth Edition covers 127 common presenting problems in both medicine and surgery in a consistent format.\nEach topic includes a list of all potential causes of the condition, colour coded to indicate common, occasional or rare causes. Important geographical variations are also highlighted.\nTwo sections cover the differential diagnosis of biochemical and haematological disorders which provide a ready check when reviewing abnormal results\nThe text includes a targeted guide to the relevant general and specific follow-up investigations which should be carried out as appropriate.\nAt the end of each topic a box highlights important learning points, or indicates symptom and signs suggestive of significant pathology which require urgent action.\nEighty colour photographs of key clinical presentations have been added to assist symptom recognition.\nTwo new chapters on Hypotension and Photophobia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c775d27e13014513aa4a2a8950d0d5dda18b0ba","amp;dn":"Churchill%27s+Pocketbook+of+Differential+Diagnosis+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c775d27e13014513aa4a2a8950d0d5dda18b0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,119,93,39,225,48,20,81,58,164,162,168,149,13,13,93,218,24,176,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
