It stars Ian McKellen as Whale, along with Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave, Lolita Davidovich, and David Dukes. The movie was adapted by Bill Condon (who also directed) from the novel Father of Frankenstein by Christopher Bram. It was executive produced by famed British horror novelist Clive Barker.\n\nThe film won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Ian McKellen) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Lynn Redgrave).\n\nThe film features reconstructions of the filming of Bride of Frankenstein, a movie Whale directed. The title comes from a line in Bride of Frankenstein.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120684/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120684/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673deca27e289280d3395ca632a1b3f5f16873f6","amp;dn":"GODS+AND+MONSTERS+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673deca27e289280d3395ca632a1b3f5f16873f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,61,236,162,126,40,146,128,211,57,92,166,50,161,179,245,241,104,115,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
