After seeing them at work and several creative ways of tuning a piano (such as removing the offending key and cutting the key itself to a shorter length), the two attend an opera singers performance. The singer passes out when the piano plays a wrong note, and Tom and Jerry are pressed into service to re-tune the piano. After pulling the offending key from the keyboard like a bad tooth, the two give the opera audience a jazz piano performance, with the now recovered opera singer joining in.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151965/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151965/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a0396447caec10a457c57418d4896bc35fcf8e","amp;dn":"Tom+and+Jerry+-+Piano+Tooners+%281932%29%28avi%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a0396447caec10a457c57418d4896bc35fcf8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,160,57,100,71,202,236,16,164,87,197,116,24,212,137,107,195,95,207,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
