The band first gained popularity in Europe, signing to Bella Union Records and later playing at festivals such as Les Inrockuptibles, Wintercase, End of the Road and South by Southwest.\n\nReview:\nMidlake donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough credit for being ahead of their time. Actually, they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any credit, understandable in light of the Denton, Tex., sextet's antiquated imagery and sepia-drunk sound. But the formula that made The Trials of Van Occupanther a sleeper hit in 2006Ã¢â‚¬â€bearded indie-folk meets California soft-rock meets Fleetwood Mac at their most glassy-eyedÃ¢â‚¬â€would likely make it a massive success in 2013. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly in their best interest to revisit that style after the clock-stopping Tull torpor of The Courage of Others, and guitarist Eric Pulido claims their fourth LP Antiphon Ã¢â‚¬Å“is the most honest representation of the band as a whole.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Except he goes on to say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“as opposed to one personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision that we were trying to facilitate.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pulido got an internal promotion to frontman after the departure of singer-songwriter Tim Smith in 2012, and...shots fired?\nAntiphon does somehow manage to be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“forget everything you know about Midlake!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ album as well as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“return to form,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at least if you remember that Van Occupanther was preceded by the burlier, less precious (title aside) Bamnan and Silvercork in 2004. PulidoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words foreshadow a more aggressive tack on the part of Midlake and they certainly oblige during the first half of Antiphon. If the title track and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProviderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly boogie, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at least rollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and tumblinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with the shuffling beats and sticky, distorted guitar leads that invert MidlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous ratio of rock to folk. More notably, the flutes and other non-strung instruments are pushed to the periphery, foregrounding a lightly psychedelic blues that I suppose recalls Fleetwood Mac before their big personnel shakeup. Likewise, Pulido begins the record asking the listener to Ã¢â‚¬Å“start a war,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and goes on to speak of foxholes and space shuttles. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even one song called Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Going DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound all that more vigorous than what came before it, but hey, make your own Yung Joc &quot;meet me at the farmer's market&quot; jokes.\nBut throughout, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s departure is an amputation that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change MidlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DNA. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a couple of opening gigs for Pearl Jam in the near future, so that should give you an idea of whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve retained the earnestness of their previous work. Pulido doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinct, dulcet tone, though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually to MidlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advantage on Antiphon. His vocals are alopecia-stricken, almost fascinating in their lack of texture even when layered in harmony, offering no resistance to the bulkier music backing him. So Antiphon never sounds awkward even when he sings about space travel on Ã¢â‚¬Å“CorruptionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“we went to the moon/ with a tycoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) in a way that comes off as quaint as the more typically Midlake-y concerns like sorting out Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Old and the YoungÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and having a good woman waiting at home by the fire. \nThe bigger shift is in the production, provided by Grammy-nominated Tony Hoffer. His most frequently cited credits are Beck and Air, who both ended up working with Nigel Godrich on their very next albums, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to think of his aesthetic as a kind of Radiohead starter kit. Midlake get that kind of sound hereÃ¢â‚¬â€you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t call it overproduced, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tons of production if you know where to listen for it, as the stereo panning is neatly utilized, the percussion crisp and non-obtrusive, while all of the folk instruments are spit-shined and shellacked. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a retro-modernist (or modernist-retro) schematic, aspiring for Laurel Canyon decor while paying West Hollywood rent.\nAs far as, the songs themselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€well, to AntiphonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s credit, it's a very consistent record. And to its detriment, it's a very consistent record. While Antiphon might be the most honest representation of Midlake, SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ostensible iron fist penned songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“RoscoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Gathered In SpringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, songs that bore a personality and vision that the overly democratic Antiphon eschews. The nice things I thought I was going to say about the title track are actually applicable to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProviderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ once I remembered which one was which. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Going DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also stood out mainly because it repeats the title, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ValeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ only because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an instrumental and thus the most memorable song here by default. After Ã¢â‚¬Å“ValeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, side B of Antiphon has about as much melodic grounding as a drone record, and if it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for a reprise of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProviderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the close, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be hard pressed to recall the goodwill generated at the beginning.\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problematic, because if they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to offer much in the way of innovation or currency, Midlake should at the very least be tuneful enough to counterbalance it. In our review of SwansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pulverizing two-hour art-rock opus The Seer, Mike Powell explained its appeal by paraphrasing a quote from Ben Marcus regarding the nature of experimental fiction: it wasn't a record for someone deciding whether or not they'd rather be listening to music or playing paintball. By the same token, Midlake isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t competing with Swans records. Considering who they are competing with makes for an even less flattering comparison. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not hard to find folky rock bands with stronger melodies, bolder personae, or even ones that are just flat-out weirder while operating squarely within the mainstream: letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not forget that Fleet Foxes used a couple minutes of saxophone on their last album and purists flipped the fuck out. That doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change the fact that Antiphon is still a likeable, pleasant listen that will always wait for you by the hearth after a long day. But for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“forget everything you know about Midlake!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ album, it's almost exactly how you remember them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01. Antiphon (03:17)\n02. Provider (03:48)\n03.
