It spent 7 weeks at the top of the Australian Album charts in 1982. It spawned the 1982 number one single in Australia &quot;What About Me&quot;.\n\nThe original 1981 version of the album was the fourth most popular album of the year in the band's native Australia, after Men at Work's Business as Usual, The Human League's Dare, and the soundtrack to Chariots of Fire. The collection features their biggest hit, &quot;What About Me&quot;, which was the second biggest hit of 1982 in Australia, after Survivor's &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;. Moving Pictures' hit won 'Best Single' at the 1982 Countdown Music Awards. In the U.S., &quot;What About Me&quot; was a top 30 hit during its lengthy first Hot 100 chart run in 1982, and narrowly missed hitting the top 40 a second time upon its re-release in 1989. A greatest hits album by the band is based entirely on Days of Innocence, plus new songs by Moving Pictures.\n\n1.&quot;Nothing to Do&quot; (Alex Smith, Garry Frost) - 3:28\n2.&quot;What About Me&quot; (Garry Frost, Frances Swan Frost) - 3:32\n3.&quot;Round Again&quot; (A.
