What followed was a two-hour-plus tour de force of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature blues-infused rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll that instantly became part of the legend of Led Zeppelin. Founding members John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were joined by Jason Bonham, the son of their late drummer John Bonham, to perform 16 songs from their celebrated catalog including landmark tracks Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whole Lotta Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock And Roll,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kashmir,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stairway To Heaven.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nA film of the show, &quot;Celebration Day, is now available on DVD and includes the entire concert in HD video and in 5.1, 48/24 hi-resolution audio surround sound. &quot;Celebration Day&quot; is an incredible document of the now legendary concert, which has been described as possibly the greatest rock and roll concert ever. The two hour feature length film is presented in beautiful high definition video, and stunning audio quality. The aspect ratio is 16x9. The film is directed by Dick Carruthers who had previously worked with Led Zeppelin on their award winning 2003 release &quot;DVD&quot; - a release that remains one of the highest selling music DVD's of all time. The &quot;Celebration Day&quot; film is already critically acclaimed and the DVD release is certain to become a consistently high selling title in the Led Zeppelin catalog.\n\n\nCD1:\n\n1.
