Beginning in 1957 and continuing on-and-off for the next 15 years, Welles self-financed and directed an audacious film version of Cervantes&amp;#039; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; which brought the legendary knight and his rotund aide Sancho Panza out of 16th century Andalusia and into the world of (then-) modern Spain. But despite his genius behind the camera, Welles was remarkably neglectful in maintaining and preserving the footage he created and much of his work was considered lost...and the footage that remained was not properly stored! However, throughout the 1980s and early 1990s the Spanish filmmakers Jess Franco (who served as Welles&amp;#039; second unit director on &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;) and Patxi Irigoyen tracked down nearly all of the surviving footage, finished the incomplete soundtrack based on Welles&amp;#039; notes, restored the footage where they could and offered a reconstructed &quot;Don Quixote de Orson Welles&quot; in 1992.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea212c031a0159a2a3d18ea9fd6e20c53c0e1302","amp;dn":"1992.Don+Quijote+%28Dom+Quixote%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea212c031a0159a2a3d18ea9fd6e20c53c0e1302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,33,44,3,26,1,89,162,163,209,142,169,253,110,32,197,60,14,19,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
