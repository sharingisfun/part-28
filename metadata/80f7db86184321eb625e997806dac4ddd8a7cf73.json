He joined the Navy in 1942 and served in the Pacific. He worked as a disc jockey, advertising executive, magazine editor, and PR man before his writing career took off in 1960 with The Marriage Cage, a comic mystery that earned him a Best First Novel Edgar Award nomination from the Mystery Writers of America. He followed that book with a slew of pulp titles for Monarch Books, ranging from light comedy (The Power of Positive Loving) to medical romance (the Doctor Starr trilogy) to soft-core erotica (Save Her for Loving, Teen Age Tramp, Girls on the Wing).\n\nThe Get Smart Series is based on the hilarious Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent working for CONTROL\n\n1. Get Smart (1965)\nMax trails a robot called Fred and must keep him from falling into the hands\nof the evil FLAG organization.\n\n2. Sorry, Chief! (1966)\nMax must stop the nasty Dr. X from marketing his invisibility serum to the boys at Kaos. \n\n3. Get Smart Once Again! (1966)\n86 &amp; a cryptographer by the name of Peaches Twelvetrees attempt to break KaosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ doomsday plan. Their only problem is that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being stalked by a rubber faced Kaos agent known as I.M. Noman.\n\n4. Max Smart and the Perilous Pellets (1966)\nControl has to plant pellets in\nKaos installations before KaosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pellet-planter plants all of KaosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pellets in ControlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s installations. The question is: can that sentence be read aloud without a stutter?\n\n5. Missed It By That Much! (1967)\nThe stench of Brassica-Oleracia-212Ã‚Âº is wiping out villages everywhere and Max &amp; 99 must put a stop to it before KAOS magician Whitestone puts a stop to them.\n\n6. And Loving It! (1967)\nControl &amp; KAOS team up in this book to fight hypnotist Guru Optimo. They can all be glad it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the Maharishi\n-or for that matter, Larry Storch and the rest of the Scared Cows.\n\n7. Max Smart- The Spy Who Went Out to the Cold (1968)\nMax &amp; 99 must take absent minded professor Wormser Von Boom to the north pole to protect him from Kaos. As usual, their plans turn to chaos and the group spends more\ntime losing the professor than protecting him. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found this book to be the best thus far.\n\n8. Max Smart Loses Control (1968)\nThis time with the help of Hymie the robot, 86 &amp; 99 must save the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swiftest computer from KAOS creeps Ways and Means.\n\n9.Max Smart and the Ghastly Ghost Affair (1969)\nMax &amp; 99 are assigned to trail the germ-fearing Kaos assassin Arbuthnot to an assassin seminar in the middle of a ghost town. What they find is the ghost of a crusty old prospector and his mule. For the sake of trivia, Max claims in this book that he has two very blue eyes while the cover features a Max with two very brown eyes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f7db86184321eb625e997806dac4ddd8a7cf73","amp;dn":"Get+Smart+series+-+William+Johnston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f7db86184321eb625e997806dac4ddd8a7cf73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,247,219,134,24,67,33,235,98,94,153,120,6,218,196,221,216,167,207,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
