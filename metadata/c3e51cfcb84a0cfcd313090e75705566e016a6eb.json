The Dustbowl. A fugitive named Ben Hawkins finds refuge within a traveling carnival comprised of a \r\n\r\ntarot card reader and her catatonic/telekinetic mother, a blind mentalist, a bearded lady, and conjoined twins, \r\n\r\namongst others. The carnival is owned by the mysterious and unseen Management, who has designs on the young Hawkins, \r\n\r\nfor the boy is concealing an untapped gift: he can heal the lame and raise the dead--at a price. Ben also finds \r\n\r\nhimself disturbed by cryptic and prophetic dreams, which he shares with a Methodist preacher in California, Brother \r\n\r\nJustin Crowe. Brother Justin, convinced by his dreams he is following God's will, has begun to practice his own \r\n\r\nextraordinary talents, although the preacher's plans increasingly lead to disturbing and tragic consequences. In this \r\n\r\n&quot;last great age of magic,&quot; Ben Hawkins and Justin Crowe are moving toward a great conflict between Good and Evil, \r\n\r\nalthough it not yet clear on which sides these men will stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMDB Rating = 8.5 (33,654)\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************************\r\n\r\n****-Note About DvD-**** \r\n\r\nNothing has been added nor taken away it is as I received it. If there are no subs in your required language it is \r\n\r\nbecause there were none on the DvD and I was unable to procure a DvD with those Subs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngenting har lagts till eller tagits bort Ã¤r det som jag fick den. Om det inte finns nÃ¥gra subs i ditt Ã¶nskat sprÃ¥k \r\n\r\nÃ¤r det fÃ¶r att det fanns ingen pÃ¥ DVD och jag kunde inte skaffa en DVD med dessa Subs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiets is toegevoegd of weggenomen is als ik hem ontving. Als er geen subs in uw gewenste taal is het omdat er geen \r\n\r\nwaren op de DVD en ik was niet in staat om een â€‹â€‹DVD te kopen met die Subs.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance go to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is \r\n\r\nmuch appreciated *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319969","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e51cfcb84a0cfcd313090e75705566e016a6eb","amp;dn":"Carnivale+Season+1+Multi+Audio+and+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e51cfcb84a0cfcd313090e75705566e016a6eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,229,28,252,184,74,12,252,211,19,9,14,117,112,85,102,224,22,166,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
