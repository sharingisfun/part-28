But when a sophisticated terrorist cell shows up in his home town, he's drawn into a conflict that threatens the heart and soul of every mother in America. The bonds of love and loyalty are tested as Jake and his friends are swept into a deadly chase that takes them from the beaches of California, to the depths of the world's longest underground river, and finally to the remote jungles of the Venezuelan rain forest--where Jake discovers that it will take far more than his enhanced abilities to prevent what is coming.\n\n&lt;size=&quot;20&quot; &lt;b&gt; The file formats for the book are MOBI and Epub &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/size&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de08a7a527e13985acb3593d2e4acf584d2dae1","amp;dn":"Brainrush+II+-+Richard+Bard%5BEPUB%2FMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de08a7a527e13985acb3593d2e4acf584d2dae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,224,138,122,82,126,19,152,90,203,53,147,210,228,172,245,132,210,218,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
