It specialized in blues, R&amp;B, gospel music, early rock and roll, and occasional jazz releases.\nRun by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess, the company produced and released many important singles and albums, which are now regarded as central to the rock music canon. Musician and critic Cub Koda described Chess Records as &quot;America's greatest blues label.&quot;Chess Records was based at several different locations on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, the most famous being at 2120 S. Michigan Avenue from c. 1956 to c. 1965, immortalized by British rock group The Rolling Stones in &quot;2120 South Michigan Avenue&quot;, an instrumental recorded at that address during their first U.S. tour in 1964; the Stones would record at Chess Studios on two more occasions. The building is now home to Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven Foundation.\n\n           \n\nDISC ONE:\n\n  1. Rocket 88 - Jackie Brenston And His Delta Cats                \n  2.
