From generation to generation they pushed ever westward\nwith a restless, wandering urge, a kinship with the free, wild\nplaces and a fierce independence. The Sacketts always stood tall\nand, true to their strong family pride, they would unite to take on\nany and all challenges, no matter how overwhelming the odds. Each\nSackett novel is a complete, exciting historical adventure, and as\na group, Louis L'Amour's The Sacketts form an epic story of the\nbuilding of our mighty nation, a saga that has thrilled millions.\nAnd now, for the very first time, The Sacketts are presented in an\nexclusive audio series that listeners will cherish for years to come.\n\nWilliam Tell Sackett had followed a different path from his younger\nbrothers, but his name, like theirs, was spoken with respect and\njust a little fear. Where Orrin had brought law and order from New\nMexico to the plains of Montana, backed up by the gunfighting\ntalents of his brother Tye, Tell Sackett's destiny drew him to\nTexas after he had to kill a man. There, in the high, lonesome\ncountry, he came upon a vein of pure gold. All he'd wanted was\nenough to buy a ranch, but he soon learned that gold had ways of\nits own with men.\n\n----\n\nLouis L'Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of\nall time. He is the only American-born author in history to receive\nboth the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold\nMedal in honor of his life's work. He has published ninety novels;\ntwenty-seven short-story collections; two works of nonfiction; a\nmemoir, Education of a Wandering Man; and a volume of poetry, Smoke\nfrom This Altar. There are more than 300 million copies of his\nbooks in print worldwide.\n\n----\n\nRead by David Starthairn\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d233d116d0e9b8be67fc3dc7db7b5537f3cb02","amp;dn":"Louis+L%5C%27Amour+-+Sackett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d233d116d0e9b8be67fc3dc7db7b5537f3cb02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,210,51,209,22,208,233,184,190,103,252,61,199,219,123,85,55,243,203,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
