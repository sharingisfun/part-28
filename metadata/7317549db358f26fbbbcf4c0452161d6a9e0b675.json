Theories come alive through the inclusion of quotations from the theoristsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ writings and numerous applications such as dream interpretation, psychopathology, and psychotherapy.\n\nSignificant changes in the 7th edition include an extended discussion of the practical applications of personality theory, with an emphasis on guidelines that can help people increase their self-knowledge, make better decisions, and live more fulfilling lives.\n\nFictionalized but true-to-life examples illustrating the perils of inadequate self-knowledge include college students, parents, terrorists, business executives, and politicians, while other examples show the positive outcomes that can result from a better understanding of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unconscious.\n\nThis 7th edition also includes a more extensive discussion of how a lack of self-understanding caused difficulties for such noted theorists as Freud and Erikson, and a new section that explains how behavior can be strongly influenced by the situation as well as by oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personality.\n\nFinally, a new interactive web site provides practice test questions and other topics of interest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7317549db358f26fbbbcf4c0452161d6a9e0b675","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Theories+of+Personality%2C+7E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7317549db358f26fbbbcf4c0452161d6a9e0b675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,23,84,157,179,88,242,111,187,188,244,192,69,33,97,214,169,224,182,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
