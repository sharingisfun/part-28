AWARD. Ancient, Ancient collects the short fiction by Kiini Ibura Salaam, of which acclaimed author and critic Nalo Hopkinson writes, ''Salaam treats words like the seductive weapons they are. She wields them to weave fierce, gorgeous stories that stroke your sensibilities, challenge your preconceptions, and leave you breathless with their beauty.'' Indeed, Ms. Salaam's stories are so permeated with sensuality that in her introduction to Ancient, Ancient, Nisi Shawl, author of the award-winning Filter House, writes, ''Sexuality-cum-sensuality is the experiential link between mind and matter, the vivid and eternal refutation of the alleged dichotomy between them. This understanding is the foundation of my 2004 pronouncement on the burgeoning sexuality implicit in sf's Afro-diasporization. It is the core of many African-based philosophies. And it is the throbbing, glistening heart of Kiini's body of work. This book is alive. Be not afraid.''\nGenre: Fantasy/Sci-fi Anthologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5070d39e05fb2add8b2cb2f1f9ecf034437a768a","amp;dn":"Ancient%2C+Ancient+-+Kiini+Ibura+Salaam.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5070d39e05fb2add8b2cb2f1f9ecf034437a768a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,112,211,158,5,251,42,221,139,44,178,241,249,236,240,52,67,122,118,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
