He has recorded and toured with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered around his native New Jersey. His eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including eighteen Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. His most famous albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life. He has sold over 65 million albums in the U.S.\n\nBruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band: Live In New York City is the name of a concert film done by HBO, featuring the first ever major televised Bruce Springsteen concert. It was later released on DVD with 11 extra songs not televised, and as a CD of the same name.\n\nReleased on March 27, 2001, the album reached #5 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Billboard Internet Album Charts. The album was later re-released on SACD with a 5.1-surround multichannel mix; the SACD running order is identical to that of the CD release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4266f03fa8a9106f9757db3547f47b78a67634d","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+%26+The+E+Street+Band+-+Live+In+New+York+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4266f03fa8a9106f9757db3547f47b78a67634d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,38,111,3,250,138,145,6,249,117,125,179,84,127,71,183,138,103,99,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
