It casts a hard look at a president whose training on ChicagoÃƒâ€ s political \nplayground shines through every bent law and every broken promise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5440902f40e48e5112df514ab1a8666aa79a1ede","amp;dn":"Gangster.Government.Barack.Obama.and.The.New.Washington..by.Davi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5440902f40e48e5112df514ab1a8666aa79a1ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,64,144,47,64,228,142,81,18,223,81,74,177,168,102,106,167,154,30,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
