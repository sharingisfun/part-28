'Wired' magazine editor Anderson expands his influential 2004 article into a comprehensive exploration of this phenomenon -- which, simply stated, holds that products with low demand or sales volume can collectively comprise a market that exceeds the bestsellers. Catering to the tastes and expectations of consumers increasingly disenchanted with the same old thing, these new &quot;niches&quot; provide limitless opportunity for savvy companies. Fresh, insightful, and surprisingly accessible, 'The Long Tail' explains how to tap into the new economics of abundance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:658dd246dd5ea0adeb784bcc9dfa6db19a0808ad","amp;dn":"The+Long+Tail+-+Chris+Anderson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"658dd246dd5ea0adeb784bcc9dfa6db19a0808ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,141,210,70,221,94,160,173,235,120,75,204,157,250,109,177,154,8,8,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
