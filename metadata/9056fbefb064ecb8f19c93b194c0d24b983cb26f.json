Most of his stories are about the adventures of a codependent yet resentful couple named Amy and Jordan.\n\nHis work was prominently featured in RAW Magazine. In fact, he was the only artist aside from founder Art Spiegelman to be published in every issue during its run. He has also been published in New York Press and New Musical Express. Beyer also had a recurring animated short series on MTV's Liquid Television (The Adventures of Thomas and Nardo), and a 1995 movie by Gregg Araki, The Doom Generation, was loosely based on the Amy and Jordan strips.\n\nHe has also produced cover artwork (X Man and X in Paris for Michael Brodsky), T-shirts and posters for John Zorn and the New York Downtown avant-garde music scene. In particular the cover and inserts for Zorn's tribute to Ornette Coleman Spy vs Spy (1989) and a popular Naked City T-shirt.\n\nAlthough he mostly works solo, Beyer has collaborated with writer Alan Moore.\n\nHe is originally from Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the state's Lehigh Valley region.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9056fbefb064ecb8f19c93b194c0d24b983cb26f","amp;dn":"Mark+Beyer+-+Agony+%28GN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9056fbefb064ecb8f19c93b194c0d24b983cb26f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,86,251,239,176,100,236,184,241,156,147,177,148,192,210,75,152,60,178,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
