Just Like A Woman\n* best guess on song title, could be a cover of the Gene Summers and The Platinum Fog's Hot Pants which was released in Feb. 71. It is not the same Hot Pants as the one recorded by James Brown.\n\nLength: 63:02\n\nNotes:\nHere is an excellent sounding and complete FM broadcast of B.B. King at the Paramount Theatre courtesy of taperpat. The recording was done by his friend Dick who recorded this off of KISW-FM using a Sony R-2-R deck when it was originally broadcast sometime in 1972. This is really hot performance by B.B. King and especially his backing band. The backing band's rendition of Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song) by Otis Redding almost steals the show before B.B. can even get on stage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f34377451dbe4d748d27567ebd8d9909b15be2","amp;dn":"B.B.+King+1971-05-30+Seattle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f34377451dbe4d748d27567ebd8d9909b15be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,243,67,119,69,29,190,77,116,141,39,86,126,189,141,153,9,177,91,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
