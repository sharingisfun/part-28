Throughout his life, Milligan also wrote prolifically - scripts, poetry, fiction, as well as several volumes of memoir, in which he took an entirely idiosyncratic approach to the truth. In this ground-breaking work, Norma Farnes, his long-time manager, companion, counsellor and confidante, gathers together the loose threads, reads between the lines and draws on the full breadth of his writing to present his life in his own words: an autobiography - of sorts.\n\n\nFrom his childhood in India, through his early career as a jazz musician and sketch-show entertainer, his spells in North Africa and Italy with the Royal Artillery, to that fateful first broadcast of The Goon Show and beyond into the annals of comedy history, this is the autobiography Milligan never wrote.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513bf46c5e1b53bbd1bcfe7a33a04b70d9798b61","amp;dn":"Milligan%27s+Meaning+of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513bf46c5e1b53bbd1bcfe7a33a04b70d9798b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,59,244,108,94,27,83,187,209,188,254,122,51,160,75,112,217,121,139,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
