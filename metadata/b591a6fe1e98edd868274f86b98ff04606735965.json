A sermon by Rev. Daniels persuades him to help others in every way he can, including his wife Lu's good-for-nothing brother, Claude, who's been living with them rent-free for six months, and their neighbors the Butlers, who need a car for a vacation when theirs breaks down.\n\nSam is a department store manager whose boss, H.C. Borden, wants him to sell more and socialize less. Sam's a shoulder for clerk Shirley Mae to cry on when her romance breaks up. He also gives a $5,000 loan, without his wife's knowledge, to Mr. and Mrs. Adams, who need it to save a gas station they bought.\n\nLu is fed up with Sam's generosity, particularly when he ends up paying for the Butlers' car repairs, then letting the mechanic come over for home-cooked meals. The last straw for Lu comes when she learns they have a chance to put a down payment on a new house, except Sam has lent their nest egg to the Adamses.\n\nSam is unhappy, too. He's annoyed with the Butlers, who have crashed his car and can't pay to fix it. He also wants Claude to move out. Shirley Mae's troubles come to his door after she takes too many pills. Sam even gets robbed, and the bank refuses to make him a loan.\n\nHe is at his wit's end when the Adamses surprise him with a check for $6,000. They also give Claude a job, and Shirley Mae suddenly thinks she and Claude could have a future together. Sam and Lu feel better about life, particularly when Borden surprises him with a promotion at work.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4514 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 114 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 114 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b591a6fe1e98edd868274f86b98ff04606735965","amp;dn":"Good+Sam+%281948%29+DVD9+-+Gary+Gooper%2C+Ann+Sheridan+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b591a6fe1e98edd868274f86b98ff04606735965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,145,166,254,30,152,237,216,104,39,79,134,185,143,240,70,6,115,89,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
