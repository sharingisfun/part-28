It's an up-close look at the pressure engineers and construction crews face every day... the stress of crushing deadlines, cost over-runs, and trying to achieve what often seems like the impossible. \nMega Builders provides viewers with an exciting, stimulating, inside look at some of the most spectacular mega-projects of our time.\n\n\n1)  Sheikh Zayed Bridge \nBuilding the Sheikh Zayed Bridge, the stunning grand gateway to the world's richest city, Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, is a king size headache for Mark Jones, the engineer assembling its giant signature arches. &quot;It's an architect's dream, an engineer's nightmare,&quot; he says .The bridge is millions over budget and years behind schedule. It's as much sculpture as structure, and when art meets engineering, worlds collide. No one has ever built a bridge like this. Mega Builders cameras follow Jones and his crew as they solve one frustrating challenge.\n\n2)  World Class Stadium \nSouth Africa has a lot riding on being the host of the next FIFA World Cup. It's important and prestigious. Cape Town is building a brand-new stadium for the occasion - with a challenging high-tech roof. The project is way behind schedule because there's a lack of skilled labour, and too few cranes to do the work. The notorious winds of Cape Town, late shipments, crane breakdowns - all of them keep this construction team on their toes.\n\n3)  Peak Power \nDeep in Canada's rugged western coastal mountains a new hydroelectric project is underway. It's a 600 million dollar venture diverting massive glacial rivers into a huge pipeline built against down steep mountain slopes. In the valley below turbines will be installed to generate electricity sent out to the coast by a new transmission line carved through heavy bush. A tight group of rugged bushwackers and fearless engineers are building all of it in spectacular but remote bush where grizzlies roam and eagles soar.\n\n4)  Spanning the Saigon River \nIn Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known as Saigon), engineers are on a mission to modernize. Construction is underway to raise Phu My Bridge, a brand-new $100 million cable-stayed bridge. The bridge is a cornerstone in a visionary plan of growth. Vietnam is nation rising out of a long economic slump, but as the country begins to flourish, progress is bringing gridlock to the streets of Ho Chi Minh City. The Phu My Bridge will be a critical link in a new highway system that the city's planners hope will relieve traffic congestion in the urban core.\n\n5)  London Olympic Aquatics Centre \nA group of engineers in England and Wales has taken on the biggest challenge of the next Summer Olympic Games -- the construction of a complex steel-truss roof for the new Aquatics Centre. Shaped like a giant ocean wave, it's truly a high-tech wonder. Three thousand tonnes of steel will rest on only three points, like a tripod, leaving a 115-metre span of the roof totally unsupported. The fabricators and construction crews have their orders. Get this one absolutely right, because there's no room for even a millimetre of error. Only gold-medal perfection will do.\n\n6)  Big Bosphorus Dig \nWeary commuters in Istanbul, Turkey must tough it out after the Marmaray Project is delayed four years by the discovery of the city's fourth century port with thirty-four ancient shipwrecks. It's one of the most significant maritime archaeological discoveries ever made. But, inconveniently, the port is discovered at Yenikapi, site of the biggest subway station in this $3.5 billion, seventy-seven kilometre long rapid transit project aimed at easing Istanbul's traffic woes.\n\n7)  The Fast Track \nIn Johannesburg, South Africa, engineers are less than 2 years away from delivering South Africa's first new commuter rail line in four decades. It's called the Gautrain, and it will be one of the most state-of-the-art rail systems on the continent. The Gautrain will link three vital points with 80 kilometres of track: Johannesburg's central business district, O.R. Tambo International Airport, and central Pretoria. Planners hope it will carry up to 100 000 passengers per day, and pull thousands of cars off the area's jammed highways.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/6190/c5xg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/6190/c5xg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/4800/oofu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/4800/oofu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/1876/01qw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/1876/01qw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/1716/uolk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/1716/uolk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/9774/74uv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/9774/74uv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8254/sr4c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8254/sr4c.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3912/cvk4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3912/cvk4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/1716/y2ap.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/1716/y2ap.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/631/9ku2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/631/9ku2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1352/03ht.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1352/03ht.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 46 min\nNumber Of Parts: 7\nPart Size: 1.21 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megabuilders%20Season%203&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megabuilders%20Season%203&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megabuilders%20Season%202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megabuilders%20Season%202&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megabuilders%20Season%204&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megabuilders%20Season%204&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Engineering%20Giants%20%28BBC%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Engineering%20Giants%20%28BBC%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Worlds%20Tallest%20Skyscraper&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Worlds%20Tallest%20Skyscraper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Coaster%20Build%20Off&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Coaster%20Build%20Off&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Megabuilders_Season_5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Megabuilders_Season_5&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed08428afdf5125a39beb52d636e43d4e7b37a07","amp;dn":"Discovery+Megabuilders+Season+5+7of7+The+Fast+Track+x264+720p+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed08428afdf5125a39beb52d636e43d4e7b37a07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,8,66,138,253,245,18,90,57,190,181,45,99,110,67,212,231,179,122,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
