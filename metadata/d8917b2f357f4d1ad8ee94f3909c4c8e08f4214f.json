Domain name points to a different site and the last update was a long time ago.\n\nLast supported OS was Leopard.\n\nWhen launching in Yosemite or El Capitan you would receive the error iPatch quit unexpectedly.\n\nEXC_BAD_ADDRESS exception\n\nPatched the application to run under Yosemite and El Capitan Beta.\n\nTested the app by generating a number of patches and it seems to work correctly.\n\nTrial limitations have been removed, credits to Kurt.\n\nThe only option that is currently disabled is the Do not display the Patch Description at launch. It displays the description automatically.\n\nTo disable that right click on the produced patch -&gt; Show package contents -&gt; Contents -&gt; Resources -&gt; English.lproj -&gt; delete Description.rtfd\n\nI am not sure if there is a reason this utility has been discontinued, but I like it since I can't find a similar utility with a GUI.\n\nI absolutely dislike the original icon of the app, so I am providing two options for your. Two apps, original icon and modern (also update toolbox icons).\n\nPlease test and let me know if it works ok for you.\n\nThanks,\nArchimedes64","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8917b2f357f4d1ad8ee94f3909c4c8e08f4214f","amp;dn":"iPatch+3.7.1+%5BK%27ed%5D+%26amp%3B+Fixed+for+El+Capitan.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8917b2f357f4d1ad8ee94f3909c4c8e08f4214f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,145,123,47,53,127,77,26,216,238,148,243,144,156,76,142,8,244,33,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
