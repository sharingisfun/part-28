Charles Dickens\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045030/\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademy Awards Oscar - NOMINATED - Best Costume Design\r\n\r\nThe film premiered at the Gaumont Cinema at Haymarket in London on 14 November 1952. In 1954 the Soviet Union paid Â£10,000 for the distribution rights, and it became the first British film to be shown in the Soviet Union after World War II, premiering on 29 July 1954 in a number of cities with a dubbed soundtrack. The film was followed by a Russian reprint of Dickens' book in 150,000 copies a month later.\r\n\r\nJohn Hayter is Samuel Pickwick in this delightful filmization of Dickens' seriocomic novel. Mr Pickwick is chairman of the Pickwick Club, a scholarly league operating in mid-19th century London. The Club's avowed purpose is to scrupulously study everyday life in England - not to improve or remonstrate, but simply examine, as a scientist would examine life under the microscope. The episodic storyline transports the Pickwicks all over town, from the fashionable digs of ever-in-debt roue Mr Jingle to debtor's prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x464, 25.000 fps, 1525 Kbps, 01h44m43s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, mono, 64 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles English and Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4nxf8apgh/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7bgl405mp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5juve8jr3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ffop8qs1t/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/66miymj5t/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8dc6581c79d760b378a4c0b9796d1d8a7f46ab","amp;dn":"The+Pickwick+Papers+%281952+-+UK%29+%5BCharles+Dickens%5D+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8dc6581c79d760b378a4c0b9796d1d8a7f46ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,141,198,88,28,121,215,96,179,120,164,192,185,121,109,29,138,127,70,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
