Klansmen have rallied, marched, elected civic leaders, infiltrated law enforcement, and committed crimes ranging from petty vandalism to assassination and mass murder. \n\nThis is the definitive history of the KKK in Mississippi, long recognized as one of the group's most militant and violent realms. The campaigns of terrorism by the Klan, its involvement in politics and religion, and its role as a social movement for marginalized poor whites are fully explored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41836abf1bdb1902402040ad77e854ed4361d74a","amp;dn":"The+Ku+Kux+Klan+in+Mississippi+-+A+History+%28US+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41836abf1bdb1902402040ad77e854ed4361d74a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,131,106,191,27,219,25,2,64,32,64,173,119,232,84,237,67,97,215,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
