Its mission is to deliver professional, compelling, accurate, timely and hard-hitting journalism that tells the truth about the threats to our Second Amendment rights.\n\nDecember 2012 Volume 13, Number 12\n\n---\n\nThis is from the online digital version. Active content has been disabled in the conversion to PDF.\n\n---\n\n&quot;The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.&quot; - Adolf Hitler\n\n---\n\nProve Hitler wrong.
