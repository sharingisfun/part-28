There were then several follow up items in Flash as back-stories. The first few issues featured GL/GA, and then they were all Green Lantern solo stories, with the exception of a couple co-starring issues with Flash that filled the whole issue.\n\nEventually the Green Arrow-Green Lantern team up was started back up, continuing with issue 90 several years after issue 89 had been published. This torrent collects the stories from the backs of the Flash issues as a convenient way to fill in the complete timeline. The Flash covers are not included, and the pages are just as I pulled them from previous torrents. I didn't do any scanning or anything really all that taxing, I simply pulled the pages and made them into CBR's to post up, so respect and appreciation goes to the scanners. \n\nWhere there are issue numbers seemingly missing are spots where Green Lantern did not appear in that issue of Flash in any form.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a8cde362dff0ea882ea1b0f62268427a1adf3b8","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+stories+from+Flash+in+the+early+70%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a8cde362dff0ea882ea1b0f62268427a1adf3b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,140,222,54,45,255,14,168,130,234,27,15,98,38,132,39,161,173,243,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
