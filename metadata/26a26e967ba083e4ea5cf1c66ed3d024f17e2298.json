As the years passed, they matured musically and lyrically, and they changed their musical style. So, the hybrid hardcore evolved into a modern metallic one, while the band line up stability remains the same until today. PSYCOREPATHS have organized and played in numerous shows in Greece, and they have shared the stage with names like: Rotting Christ, Septic Flesh, Tankard(GER), , Vendetta(BG), Redound(BG), Deathbed(FL), WEB, Eden Demise, Aherusia, Overgarven, Antidrasi, Vodka Juniors and many more.\n\n \nLINE UP:\n\nXTHUG15X (SPIROS G.)- VOCALS\nGREG D. - DRUMS\nFOTIS K. - BASS\nNIK L.
