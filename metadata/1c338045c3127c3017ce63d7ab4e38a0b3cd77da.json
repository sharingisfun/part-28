Last month, the Gnutella-based \nfile-sharing client LimeWire was effectively outlawed after a U.S. federal \njudge granted a request from the RIAA to shut the software down. Now, not \neven a month later, LimeWire is back as good as new. Not only has a secret \ndev team reanimated the hugely popular client, but they have also made a few \nsignificant changes which make it better and more streamlined than before.\n[img]http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/685/monkeywire.png[/img]\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/63d7/693df016.png[/img] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/limewire-resurrected-by-secret-dev-team-101108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/limewire-resurrected-by-secret-dev-team-101108/&lt;/a&gt;\nDownload from:\n\nLimeWire Pirate Edition is free, open source software based on the final beta \nversion of the popular LimeWire filesharing application. After Lime Wire LLC \nstopped distributing its software in October 2010, a horde of piratical monkeys \nclimbed aboard the abandoned ship, mended its sails, polished its cannons and \nreleased it FREE to the community to help keep the Gnutella network alive. \n\nLimeWire Pirate Edition is pure P2P software; it does not depend on any servers \noperated by Lime Wire LLC or other companies. It does not include any adware or \nspyware, and it cannot be remotely monitored or shut down.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBased on LimeWire 5.6 beta\nAll the features of LimeWire PRO:\nTurbo-charged downloads\nOptimized search results\nAVG Anti-Virus\nBuilt-in torrent search\nNo toolbars, adware or spyware\nNo connection problems\n\nMetapirate Webpage closed! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/limewire-pirate-edition-site-nuked-by-cheap-and-dishonest-riaa-action-101119/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/limewire-pirate-edition-site-nuked-by-cheap-and-dishonest-riaa-action-101119/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNot a program that I like to use!\nBut I took the precaution of downloading all three releases by Metapirates!\nAll three versions within RAR file for Windows,Mac and ubuntu/Debian:\nLimeWirePirateEdition.exe MD5\nLimeWirePirateEdition.deb MD5\nLimeWirePirateEdition.dmg MD5\n\nOnly tested the windows version...
