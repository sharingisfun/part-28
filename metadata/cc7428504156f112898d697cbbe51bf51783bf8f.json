The group includes rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, and Taboo, and singer Fergie. They are inactive as of 2011. Since the release of their third album, Elephunk, in 2003, the group has sold an estimated 56 million records worldwide. Their first worldwide song was &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot; in 2003, which topped over ten charts worldwide. Another single was the European hit &quot;Shut Up&quot;. Their next album, Monkey Business, was also a worldwide success, certified 4ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Platinum in the U.S., and spawning two singles, &quot;My Humps&quot; and &quot;Don't Phunk with My Heart&quot;.\nIn 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have ever simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; and &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot;, with the next single &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot; achieving similar success, from the album The E.N.D. Combined, these three singles also topped the chart for an unprecedented 30 consecutive weeks in 2009. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with &quot;Imma Be&quot;, making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with &quot;Rock That Body&quot; which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; has become the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.\n\n.: The Black Eyed Peas Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8601/800pxlesblackeyedpeasen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8601/800pxlesblackeyedpeasen.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1998 Behind The Front @320\n2000 Bridging The Gap @320\n2004 Elephunk (UK - Special Edition) @320\n2005 Monkey Business (UK Special Edition + 2 Bonus Tracks) @320\n2006 Monkey Business (Asia Special Edition) @320\n2009 The E.N.D (Christmas Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n\nEPs\n2006 Renegotiations The Remixes @320\n2009 Invasion Of Boom Boom Pow Megamix @32\n\nSingles\n1999 Karma (Promo CD) @320\n2001 Request Line (Maxi-Single) @320\n2001 Request Line @320\n2003 Shut Up @320\n2003 Where Is The Love @320\n2004 Let's Get It Started @320\n2005 Don't Phunk With My Heart @320\n\nFergie Albums\n2007 - The Dutchess (Japan Edition) @320\n2008 - The Dutchess (Deluxe Edition) @320\n\nFergie some Singles\n006 - London Bridge (CDS) @320\n007 - Clumsy (CDM) @320\n007 - Glamorous (CDM) @320\n008 - Koda Kumi - That Ain't Cool (feat.
