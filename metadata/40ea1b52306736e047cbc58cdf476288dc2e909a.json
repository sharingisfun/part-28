Crucial to their sold-out shows and their big fan base in Austria is an explosive live show of the 8-piece outfit with their unique punk rooted mixture of ska, rock, swing, reggae and pop music. The brass section consisting of two trumpets, a trombone and a saxophone makes the melodies for the millions and plays the songs directly into the hearts of the fans. Watching the boys, everyone realises that they really feel their music with every bone in their bodies: pure energy.Although the band members Ã¢â‚¬â€œ aged from 21 to 25 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ seem to be relatively young, they can look back on an 8-Year-band-history, 2 album releases, alive DVD and over 200 shows in 9 different countries. Amongst others,they have shared the stage with legendary bands, including Guns n Roses, The Offspring, Velvet Revolver, Bloodhound Gang, Mando Diao, Asian Dub Foundation, The Hives and Flogging Molly. Guadalajara have appeared at the biggest festivals in Austria, which include the Novarock festival, the Frequency festival,the 2 Days a week Festival in Wiesen and the Donauinselfest, the biggest open air festival in Europe.\n\n\nAll you can dance\n\n1   All I want\n2   Ska me up\n3   Sunday morning\n4   Swing it away\n5   Keep on rocking\n6   Between two worlds\n7   Mexican Chili\n8   Remember\n9   Mondays\n10  WAMFAG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ea1b52306736e047cbc58cdf476288dc2e909a","amp;dn":"Guadalajara+-+All+you+can+dance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ea1b52306736e047cbc58cdf476288dc2e909a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,234,27,82,48,103,54,224,71,203,197,140,223,71,98,136,220,46,144,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
