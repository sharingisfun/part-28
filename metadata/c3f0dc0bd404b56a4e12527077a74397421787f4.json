Lee and Chatman are also the creators of Wonder Showzen. The show is produced by PFFR, with animation by Cinematico. It premiered at midnight on November 4, 2007 on Adult Swim, and November 1, 2007 on AdultSwim.com.\n\nThe show features a style characterized by a very loosely formed, noncontinuous plot and the ubiquitous use of surrealist, absurdist humor through a pseudo-shamanistic/New Age lens. The program is also normally rated TV-MA for intense, graphic, often bloody violence (V), as well as strong sexual content, use of racially/ethnically offensive language, and grotesque depictions in a comedic manner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f0dc0bd404b56a4e12527077a74397421787f4","amp;dn":"Xavier+-+Renegade+Angel+-+Season+2+DVD-R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f0dc0bd404b56a4e12527077a74397421787f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,240,220,11,212,4,181,106,78,18,82,112,119,167,67,151,66,23,135,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
