A TV series based on the books aired from 1998 to 2001, and has inspired two spin-offs, Weirdsister College (2001) and The New Worst Witch (2005).\n\nGenre: ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fiction\n\n\n1. The Worst Witch (1974)\nMildred Hubble is the worst witch at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches - she's always getting her spells wrong.

The Worst Witch Strikes Again (1980)\nSummer term at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches has just begun and disaster-prone Mildred Hubble is in deep trouble again - all because of the new girl, Enid Nightshade, who isn't nearly as placid as she look.\n\n3. A Bad Spell for Worst Witch (1982)\nIs this the end of Mildred's witching career? Her attempts to &quot;save the school&quot; has turned Headmistress Hardbroom into a sworn enemy, and Mildred herself is turned into a frog. It could only be awful Ethel's doing--how can a frog find a friend to help? Black-and-white illustrations.\n\n4. The Worst Witch All At Sea (1993)\nMildred Hubble, the worst witch in Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, can't bear to leave behind her beloved cat, Tabby, when the class goes for a week beside the seaside. But keeping Tabby leads Mildred into yet more trouble.\n\n5. The Worst Witch Saves the Day (2005)\nThe famously disaster-prone Mildred, witch in training, flies in for a brand-new adventure that makes a perfect Halloween treat.\nMildred is starting her third year at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches with high hopes of improving her klutzy record. But that's before a curling-iron catastrophe leads her to experiment with a hair-growing potion with hair-raising results. And it's before she raises the ire of Miss Granite, the odd new teacher who doesn't seem to act like a teacher at all. Could she be an imposter? And is there anything in Mildred's bag of tricks that can save the school if her hunch is right?\n\n6. The Worst Witch to the Rescue (2007)\nAll I will say is - prepare to be astounded! Mildred Hubble has always been the worst witch at Miss Cackle's Academy, but she just knows this term will be different. She's done the best holiday project ever and she's sure that her form teacher, the fearsome Miss Hardbroom, will be impressed. Even her arch-enemy, Ethel Hallow, is being friendly to her! But is it all too good to be true - will disaster strike again for the Worst Witch? Mildred may be the worst witch at the academy but she's the best friend you could ever have. Millions of readers love her.
