We \n\njust pulled a hamstring writing that, so we're probably not cut out for it.\n\n\n- Jeff Ross -\nJeff Ross is the king of insult comedy and a roastmaster extraordinaire. Please God, don't target us, Jeff. We're overly-\n\nsensitive and cry with little-to-no provocation!\n\n\n- Gary Gulman -\nThe very funny Gary Gulman is 6'6 tall. A few more tall funny guys like him and Conan and we can field a comedy basketball \n\nteam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249caa11c87299ea15317156e5043e9f8f9c6322","amp;dn":"Conan.2015.06.02.Kellan.Lutz.720p.HDTV.x264-CROOKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249caa11c87299ea15317156e5043e9f8f9c6322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,156,170,17,200,114,153,234,21,49,113,86,229,4,62,159,143,156,99,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
