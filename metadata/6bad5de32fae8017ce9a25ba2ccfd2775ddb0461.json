Far from that, the book tackles the problem at the higher spiritual plane, in the light of the prophetic background as embodied in the Bible and subsequently manifested through historical events, high-lighting the basic similarities between the Mosaic and Muhammadan dispensations, as also the basic contradictions that have given Christianity its popular concepts, making of it a rival to its own original blueprint. It further deals, in the light of the Quranic prophecies, with the phases of decline and progress, and of the cycles of disaster and prosperity which the Muslims were destined to go through in striking similarity to the familiar history of Israel. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing is the location where Jesus is buried.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nContact for more details:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial websites:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRelated torrent:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11963082&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11963082&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11955517&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11955517&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11954461&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11954461&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11952981&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11952981&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11931022&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11931022&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bad5de32fae8017ce9a25ba2ccfd2775ddb0461","amp;dn":"Did+Jesus+Redeem+Mankind%3F+Did+he+Die+for+Our+Sins%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bad5de32fae8017ce9a25ba2ccfd2775ddb0461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,173,93,227,47,174,128,23,206,154,37,186,44,207,210,119,93,219,4,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
