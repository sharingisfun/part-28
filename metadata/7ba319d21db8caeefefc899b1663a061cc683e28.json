Very sloppy typing will magically make sense, even if you miss spaces, and SwiftKey 3 also predicts your next words.\n\n* Upgrading from SwiftKey X, you may experience trouble with apostrophes or accented characters in predictions. This is because you need to update your language models. To do this, go to Settings, Languages &amp; layouts, press menu and tap &quot;update languages&quot;. When &quot;update&quot; appears next to your language(s), press it. When you return to your keyboard things should be working properly. *\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new:\n\n* Smart Space Ã¢â‚¬â€œ adding to SwiftKeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already cutting edge correction, Smart Space detects mistyped or omitted spaces across strings of sloppily typed words in real-time.\n\n* Two new themes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a new theme, Ã¢â‚¬ËœCobaltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, to match SwiftKeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new look and feel, and an Ice Cream Sandwich-styled Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ theme, as voted for by SwiftKeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s VIP community.\n\n* An enhanced UI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a much larger space bar and smart punctuation key help improve accuracy and make it quick and easy to access common punctuation. Just tap and slide left on the period for exclamation point, or tap and slide right for question mark. No need to long-press.\n\n* Additional languages Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SwiftKey 3 now offers support for an additional seven languages, bringing the total up to 42. The new languages are Korean, Estonian, Farsi, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian and Serbian. And of course, you can still enable up to three at once.\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba319d21db8caeefefc899b1663a061cc683e28","amp;dn":"SwiftKey+3+Keyboard+v3.0.4.343+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba319d21db8caeefefc899b1663a061cc683e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,163,25,210,29,184,202,238,254,252,137,155,22,99,160,97,204,104,62,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
