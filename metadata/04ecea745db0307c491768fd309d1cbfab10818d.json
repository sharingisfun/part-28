Taking influence from Sludge/Doom/Stoner Metal Bands past and present such as Sabbath, Ramesses, Electric Wizard, YOB, EyeHateGod but bringing their own great take on the genre. Their songs are loud, angry and played to a slow sludge based mid-tempo to superb effect.\n\nLineup\nChris Sherrod- Vocals\nKevin Masters- Guitars\nScott Simmons- Bass\nJustin Ringle- Drums\n\n*Scott Simmons is now a former member.\n\nReview:\nChris superbly handles the vocals - This is old-school Sludge Metal vocals against a backdrop of great modern Stoner/Sludge metal guitar riffs with thick brutal drumming to aid the music along.\n\nThis album is simply superb from start to finish. If you are into down-tempo Sludge/Stoner Metal then you will find much to enjoy and discover here time and time again. As I have since I downloaded this brilliant album earlier this week.\n\nProduction is superb. Everything is loud and clear from start to finish. There are no flashy progressive Sludge metal riffs here. Just good old-fashioned Stoner/Doom/Sludge Metal riffs that we all know and love.\n\nCheck out tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Black MercyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTime Heals No WoundsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Epic tracks from a great band with a bright future.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nReview by The Sludgelord\n\nGenre = Sludge / Doom \nFormat = mp3\nBitrate = 320 kbps\nFile Size = 72.00 MB\n\nTrack List\n1.
