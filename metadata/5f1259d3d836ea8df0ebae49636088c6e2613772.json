Mississippi - Original single version, first time on CD\n\n\nJohn Phillips has been called one of the greatest pop songwriters of the later 20th century. The songs he wrote and performed with The Mamas and The Papas are pop classics, California Dreamin , Monday Monday, Creeque Alley among them.\n\nIn 1969, John Phillips was moving past The Mamas and The Papas, and assembled a collection of songs at his home studio that would eventually become his first solo album, and the only one to be released during his lifetime. It is an album reflective of the changing era, and the ever-changing composer and arranger.\n\nThe album was produced by Lou Adler, who also produced all of The Mamas and The PapasÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½??? recordings, as well as Carole King's Tapestry and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nPlaying on the album are many of the session musicians who contributed to the success of The Mamas and The Papas, Elvis Presley and Ricky Nelson, as well as countless other recordings in the 60s and 70s, and whom John dubbed the greatest players in the world (including Hal Blaine, Larry Knechtel, Joe Osborn, James Burton, Buddy Emmons and Red Rhodes).\n\nThis expanded and completely re-mastered edition features eight previously unreleased bonus tracks, all recorded during the original sessions for the album.\n\nThis classic album has been unavailable in the U.S. for over 36 years, and is being officially issued on CD here for the first time. It is the first in a series of official releases from the archives of the John Phillips estate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1259d3d836ea8df0ebae49636088c6e2613772","amp;dn":"John+Phillips-The+Wolfking+Of+LA-flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1259d3d836ea8df0ebae49636088c6e2613772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,18,89,211,216,54,234,141,240,235,174,73,99,96,136,198,226,97,55,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
