Solutions are to mount the phone on your PC and manually remove &quot;/mnt/secure/asec/smdl2tmp1.asec&quot; or an empty folder named &quot;.android_secure&quot;.\n- On Android 2.1 and earlier, only some apps, like Google Translation, support changing voices.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b6f0c6c2d8ab7589d3c87a39c9317d3844b1fa","amp;dn":"Svox+US+English+Grace+Voice+v2.2+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b6f0c6c2d8ab7589d3c87a39c9317d3844b1fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,182,240,198,194,216,171,117,137,211,200,122,57,201,49,125,56,68,177,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
