Now in its Eighth Edition, the program continues to reflect the realities of the contemporary French and Francophone worlds and to serve the communication needs of the new millennium. Its hallmark strengths--highly effective logical progression, clear organization, and supportive pedagogy--which have served more than half a million CONTACTS users so well, are enhanced in the Eighth Edition by the iLrn Heinle Learning Center (purchased separately). Everything your students need to master the skills and concepts of the course is built into this dynamic learning environment. The iL0618395784rn Heinle Learning Center includes an audio-enhanced eBook, assignable textbook activities, companion videos with pre- and post-viewing activities, partnered voice-recorded activities, an online workbook and lab manual with audio, interactive enrichment activities, and a diagnostic study tool to help them prepare for exams. The authors' heightened emphasis on interpersonal communication skills in this edition, presented through a broad range of stimulating activities that engage students in the many facets of the French-speaking world, is also further enhanced by the iLrn Heinle Learning Center.\n\nAbout the Authors &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3382/authors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3382/authors.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nJean-Paul and Rebecca M.
