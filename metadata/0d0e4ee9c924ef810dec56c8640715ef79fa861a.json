Within a short while, it becomes difficult to understand how we could have functioned without the knowledge gained from it. The Anglo-American Establishment is such a book.  In it Professor Carroll Quigley presents crucial 'keys' without which 20th century political, economic, and military events can never be fully understood. The reader will see that this applies to events past-present-and future.\n\nWhile the notion of conspiratorial influence on world events had gained credence with both extremities of the American political spectrum, and to a degree with the general public, the more academically-oriented person has tended to downplay such influence, largely because of the lack of scholarship in the presentation and analysis of the facts by those supporting the conspiracy theories. In addition, many such supporters have made themselves easy to ignore and, in fact, have themselves always assumed that they would be ignored. Professor Quigley's work does not suffer from these defects. The evidence he presents here appears irrefutable; the analysis-brilliant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0e4ee9c924ef810dec56c8640715ef79fa861a","amp;dn":"Carroll+Quigley+-+The+Anglo-American+Establishment+%281st+Edition%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0e4ee9c924ef810dec56c8640715ef79fa861a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,14,78,233,201,36,239,129,13,236,86,200,100,7,21,239,121,250,134,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
