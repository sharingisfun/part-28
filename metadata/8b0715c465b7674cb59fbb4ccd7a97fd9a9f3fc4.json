These are a series of one-shot issues each devoted to a classic Marvel character or team, and that tell the central story for each of the Mythos characters.\n\nStory and art are by Paul Jenkins and Paolo Rivera respectively. The art stands out on these and makes them more than just a hastily put together retelling of the origins of the central heroes in each book.\n\nThanks to the scanners and original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b0715c465b7674cb59fbb4ccd7a97fd9a9f3fc4","amp;dn":"Mythos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b0715c465b7674cb59fbb4ccd7a97fd9a9f3fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,7,21,196,101,183,103,76,181,159,187,76,205,122,151,253,154,159,63,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
