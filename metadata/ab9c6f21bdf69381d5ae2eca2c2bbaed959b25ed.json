The title comes from the book `Desolation Angels' by Jack Kerouac, one of the leaders of the beat generation, who is very influential on the artistic Dutch youth as well. It is the first Dutch blues album and draws the attention of Willem de Ridder, editor-in-chief of Hitweek.\n\nHarry's farm in Grolloo becomes a place of pilgrimage. Ton Sybrands, Simon Vinkenoog, Boudewijn de Groot, Johnny the Selfkicker, John Mayall, Eddie Boyd, and Alexis Korner all sleep at Harry's farm. A `road to fame' in Grolloo reminds us of the many, often eccentric, visitors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9c6f21bdf69381d5ae2eca2c2bbaed959b25ed","amp;dn":"Cuby%2BBlizzards-Desolation+%28Blues1966%29+Edison+award+1st+LP+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9c6f21bdf69381d5ae2eca2c2bbaed959b25ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,156,111,33,189,246,147,129,213,174,46,202,44,43,186,237,149,155,37,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
