I find it a bit slow when taking pictures with my phone but that may not be the case for you. This is the cracked full version. All you need to do is copy the apk file directly to your mobile phone's sd card (the root directory), then use a file manager app like &quot;File Manager&quot; to open that apk file from your phone and install it. Make sure to select the &quot;Package Installer&quot; because this is the cracked/pirated version. Don't select Google's verify option. Also, make sure your phone is allowed to install third party apps. If you don't know how, Google it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca7eeed1a8f1f0dcb6cee597eff44c85539dd5b9","amp;dn":"Camera+JB%2B+v3.0+-+Android+Camera+App","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca7eeed1a8f1f0dcb6cee597eff44c85539dd5b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,126,238,209,168,241,240,220,182,206,229,151,239,244,76,133,83,157,213,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
