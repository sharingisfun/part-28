In North America it was the first single released from the band's The Bridge; in Europe it followed Lucky Love.\n\nThe song was written on January 1, 1994 by band member Jonas Berggren while he was in the Canary Islands. His earlier song The Sign had just hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 list. Berggren incorporated gospel elements into the song, and the single proved quite successful worldwide, reaching #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and on the UK Singles Chart. It also hit #1 on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nThis song was also included on the Night at the Roxbury (1998) soundtrack and was featured in the advertising campaign for the movie. The song was also the first to be played the night that the Florida Marlins won Game 7 of the 1997 World Series. The song was also heard in the Adam Sandler films, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and You Don't Mess With The Zohan.\n\nThe video for the song was directed by Richard Heslop, who would go on to direct the band's later video for &quot;Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry&quot;. The video included computer generated bubbles which whisked the band from place to place.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60fcc4dcd698f445d1522bcd17da8a31a64b2e22","amp;dn":"Ace+Of+Base+-+Beautiful+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60fcc4dcd698f445d1522bcd17da8a31a64b2e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,252,196,220,214,152,244,69,209,82,43,205,23,218,138,49,166,75,46,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
