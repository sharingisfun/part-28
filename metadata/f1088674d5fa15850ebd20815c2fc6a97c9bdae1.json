Jurados punk past was held in stark contrast to the spare folk dirges that marked the beginnings of his solo career in the late 90s. While hardcore and indie folk might represent two extremes, the musicians who are versed in the ethos of punk tend to have a more imaginative approach to their folk leanings than those who come up in the sleepy coffeehouse scenes. Be it production, instrumentation, or political lyrical undertones, theres a slightly different perspective thats always under the surface. This has always been the case with Jurado, whose fragile voice and stoic playing have always just barely hidden themes of pain and longing more aggressive than helpless. With his tenth studio outing, Maraqopa, Jurado offers his most colorful and nuanced set of songs yet, and while theyre a far cry from hardcore, they wander into places well removed - and far more interesting - than his earlier wounded troubador role.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1088674d5fa15850ebd20815c2fc6a97c9bdae1","amp;dn":"Damien+Jurado+-+Maraqopa+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1088674d5fa15850ebd20815c2fc6a97c9bdae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,8,134,116,213,250,21,133,14,189,32,129,92,47,198,169,124,155,218,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
