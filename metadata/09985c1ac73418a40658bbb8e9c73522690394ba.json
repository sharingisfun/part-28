Instead of planning a walk down the aisle, she's crossing the pond with the only companion she needs; her darling dog, Bliss. Caring for a pack of show dogs in England seems the perfect distraction from the scandal that ruined her teaching career, and her reputation, in New York. \n\nWhat she doesn't count on is an unstoppable attraction to billionaire dog breeder Donovan Darcy. The London tycoon's a little bit arrogant, a whole lot sexy, and the chemistry between them is disarming. When passion is finally unleashed, might Elizabeth hope to take home more than a blue ribbon?\n\nGenre: Romance, Chick Lit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09985c1ac73418a40658bbb8e9c73522690394ba","amp;dn":"Unleashing+Mr.+Darcy+by+Teri+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09985c1ac73418a40658bbb8e9c73522690394ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,152,92,26,199,52,24,164,6,88,187,184,233,199,53,34,105,3,148,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
