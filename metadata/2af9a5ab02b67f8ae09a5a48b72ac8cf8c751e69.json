Beach Safari is a surreal tale of a male bunny &quot;stranded&quot; on an island with three beautiful young girls. And beneath the graphic novel's charming tale of summer vacations, sunbathing and friendship, runs a stirring examination of self-esteem, loneliness, and the metaphorical concept of being marooned.
