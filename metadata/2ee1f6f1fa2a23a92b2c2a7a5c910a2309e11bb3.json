Our lives are connected by a thousand\ninvisible threads, and along these sympathetic fibers, our actions run as causes\nand return to us as results.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n- Herman Melville\nHerman Melville lived in 19th century and the word internet, and RSS would not\nhave come into his mind even in his wildest dreams. Still, a lot of writers have\ncome and gone after him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t found a better statement to present our\ncontext before you.

We all crave for dollars and run after that using different\nmeans. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmeansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that we select to run our business that matters.

Before the advent of RSS and blogs,\nthese technologies used to burn out a hole in your pocket. All those days are\ngone. Now, if you have a website you only need some knowledge to make things\nhappen for you. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this vital knowledge that I am going to pass on you through\nthis book.\n\n\n\n\n      \\\\|||/\n          .-.________          (o o)             ________.-.\n     ----/ \\\\_)_______)  +-oooO--(_)-----------+ (_______(_/ \\\\----\n        (    ()___)     |Please seed after    |    (___()    )\n             ()__)      |                     |     (__()\n     ----\\\\___()_)       |     download        |      (_()___/----\n                        +------------Ooo------+\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee1f6f1fa2a23a92b2c2a7a5c910a2309e11bb3","amp;dn":"A+to+Z+about+RSS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee1f6f1fa2a23a92b2c2a7a5c910a2309e11bb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,225,246,241,250,42,35,169,43,44,42,122,92,145,10,35,9,225,27,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
