It would be the final ELO album to feature bassist Kelly Groucutt, who left the band shortly after its release.\n\nLouis Clark returned to conduct the strings once more and violinist Mik Kaminski appeared on an ELO recording for the first time since 1977's Out of the Blue, playing a violin solo on the track &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Is King.&quot; On completion of this album Jeff Lynne dismissed bassist Kelly Groucutt. Groucutt later sued for alleged lost royalties and received a settlement out of court.\n\nThe song starts off with strange effects and backmasked voices (saying &quot;welcome to the show&quot;) then a burst of morse code spelling out E.L.O. before the song properly kicks in, something Jeff Lynne also did 10 years earlier on &quot;Ocean Breakup/King of the Universe&quot; from On the Third Day. The song and album were recorded very much tongue in cheek with Jeff Lynne's love of hidden messages in songs.\n\nThe single peaked at 48 in the UK Singles Chart and at #14 in the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nElectric Light Orchestra (ELO) were a British rock group from Birmingham, who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.\n(video has a white &quot;vh1 classic&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Messages_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Messages_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NadIhaaDE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NadIhaaDE&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 5618kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:29\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
