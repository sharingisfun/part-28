Although he had spent much of his career as a studio bassist, Frigo successfully switched full-time to his first love, the violin, and was immediately considered one of the top swing-based violinists. Joined by both Bucky and John Pizzarelli on guitars, either Ron Carter or Michael Moore on bass, and drummer Butch Miles, Frigo is in wonderful form on 14 standards, including &quot;Pick Yourself Up,&quot; &quot;Detour Ahead&quot; (which he had co-written while with the Soft Winds in the late '40s), &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy&quot; and &quot;The Song Is You.&quot; This recommended CD launched the Chesky label.
