This section lays off religion for a while (it's such an easy target) in favor of political polemic and other, related topics.  I encourage you to give it a download and see for yourself.\n\nI'd also like to take a moment to honor the memory of Michael Hastings.  Anyone who hasn't heard of this man would do well to read his article on Stanley McChrystal and the war in Afghanistan (The Runaway General).  A quick Google search should turn it up along with some information regarding his recent, extremely suspicious death.  There's some fucked-up shit going on in America, folks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e999b5d1d497cb1f6b2ab4e9e9be4ac82edf150d","amp;dn":"Pirate+This+2%3A+Howling+into+the+Aether+%28Part+III%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e999b5d1d497cb1f6b2ab4e9e9be4ac82edf150d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,153,181,209,212,151,203,31,107,42,180,233,233,190,74,200,46,223,21,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
