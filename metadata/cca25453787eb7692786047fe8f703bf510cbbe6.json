She has earned 11 Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, an ALMA Award, and numerous United States and internationally certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum albums. She has also earned nominations for a Tony Award and a Golden Globe award.\n\nRonstadt has collaborated with artists from a diverse spectrum of genres including Bette Midler, Billy Eckstine, Frank Zappa, Rosemary Clooney, Flaco JimÃƒÂ©nez, Philip Glass, Warren Zevon, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Johnny Cash, and Nelson Riddle. She has lent her voice to over 120 albums and has sold more than 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times noted in 2004, Ronstadt is &quot;Blessed with arguably the most sterling set of pipes of her generation ... rarest of rarities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a chameleon who can blend into any background yet remain boldly distinctive ... It's an exceptional gift; one shared by few others.&quot;\n\nIn total, she has released over 30 studio albums and 15 compilation or greatest hits albums. Ronstadt charted 38 Billboard Hot 100 singles, with 21 reaching the top 40, 10 in the top 10, three at #2, and &quot;You're No Good&quot; at #1. This success did not translate to the UK, with only her single &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; reaching the UK Top 40. Her duet with Aaron Neville, &quot;Don't Know Much&quot;, peaked at #2 in December 1989. In addition, she has charted 36 albums, 10 top-10 albums and three #1 albums on the Billboard Pop Album Chart.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with the Arizona Daily Star she said, &quot;I am 100 percent retired and I'm not doing anything any more&quot;. It was announced publicly in August 2013 that Ronstadt had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in December 2012, which left her unable to sing.\n\nHer autobiography, Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir, was released in September 2013. It debuted in the Top 10 on The New York Times Best Sellers List.\n\nLinda Ronstadt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014. On July 28, 2014, she was awarded one of the twelve 2013 National Medals of Arts and Humanities.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLinda Ronstadt was arguably the most popular female vocalist in America when she recorded a series of shows on her 1976 US tour for the King Biscuit Flower Hour. It took nearly six years from the time she hit gold with her first group, The Stone Poneys, to the time she would finally be at the top of the charts as a solo artist, but throughout this period Ronstadt continued to be an extraordinary interpreter of the best pop, rock and country songwriters of the era. With the help of some savvy producers and a great band of supporting musicians dedicated to making her sound as good as possible, Ronstadt continually delivered great covers such as Buddy Holly's That'll Be The Day, Eric Kaz's Love Has No Pride, Dusty Springfield's Silver Threads And Golden Needles, Lowell George's Willin ,' Paul Anka's It Doesn't Matter Anymore, the Everly Brothers', When Will I Be Loved? and Willie Nelson's Crazy, originally a massive country hit for Patsy Cline in 1963. She mixes up-tempo rockers like her re-make of You're No Good and the Motown classic, Heat Wave with tender ballads such as the Eagles' Desperado and her friend Karla Bonoff's tear jerker, Someone To Lay Down Beside Me. In all, it was always an incredibly well-rounded set of material when Ronstadt took the stage. This show was no exception. One of the few female singers of considerable depth and musical substance to come out of the 1970s Southern California music scene, Ronstadt would be wildly popular with both fans and music industry insiders for many years after this show was recorded. She had her first radio hit, Mike Nesmith s classic country ballad Different Drum, in 1967 with the Stone Poneys, and she began a string of successful solo LPs in 1969 on Capitol Records, members of her band including future Eagles Don Henley and Glen Frey. Her breakthrough records would come with 1973's Don't Cry Now and 1974's Heart like a Wheel. Ronstadt would remain a female musical icon through most of the early 1990s, when she plunged into more eclectic musical projects and collaborations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca25453787eb7692786047fe8f703bf510cbbe6","amp;dn":"Linda+Ronstadt%2FWillin%27+In+LA-The+1976+Broadcast+%5B2015%5D%5B320KBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca25453787eb7692786047fe8f703bf510cbbe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,162,84,83,120,126,183,105,39,134,4,127,232,247,3,191,81,12,187,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
