Here is a synopsis of this amazing, very rare and hard to get book:\n\nThe book, which exposes corruption in the criminal legal system of Smith County, Texas, USA, was withdrawn by the publisher and removed from all bookstores shortly after publication due to pressure from the authorities exposed in the book. Since then, there has been a concerted effort to suppress the work, resulting in used editions of the book becoming rare and expensive (currently $500 on amazon). It is hoped that the availability of this electronic editition will make that suppression more difficult.\n\nA very fascinating book indeed, especially if you liked the 1991 movie Rush","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3230d6d1428619112a95e9f5ae8965e73c75eb3d","amp;dn":"Smith+County+Justice+%28David+Ellsworth%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3230d6d1428619112a95e9f5ae8965e73c75eb3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,48,214,209,66,134,25,17,42,149,233,245,174,137,101,231,60,117,235,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
