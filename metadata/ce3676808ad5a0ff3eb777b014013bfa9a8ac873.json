However, the band were not happy with the results. Consequently, the material from these shows would make up videos and B-sides for the A Momentary Lapse of Reason singles and later these shows were released as a bootleg recording entitled Pink Floyd: The Calhoun Tapes. Then in August 1988, the band went to Nassau Coliseum and filmed and recorded their five night stand for Delicate Sound of Thunder at the end of the initial Momentary Lapse 1987/88 tour.\n\nThe album was released in 1988 as a double LP, double cassette, and a double CD, each format containing a slightly different track listing. The album includes many works from A Momentary Lapse of Reason as well as quite a few from older albums. The double LP format did not have &quot;Us and Them&quot; on the track listing. Both the double LP and the double cassette had &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; between &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;.\n\nAlthough David Gilmour stated around the time of its release and on a radio interview in 1992 that the album contained no studio overdubbing whatsoever, he embellished the tracks during mixing with some extra acoustic guitar on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, according to engineer Buford Jones. In addition, some harmonies were replaced by studio re-takes: Richard Wright re-did his vocal on &quot;Us and Them&quot; and Sam Brown replaced Rachel Fury's part in &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;.[1][dead link]\n\nAn accompanying video recording of one of the concerts was also released.\n\nDelicate Sound of Thunder (the album) reached #11 on the Billboard 200 and is currently listed as Triple Platinum in U.S. sales ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it was certified Gold and Platinum on January 23, 1989 and Triple Platinum in April 1997.\n\nDelicate Sound of Thunder became the first rock album to be played in space, as Soviet cosmonauts took it aboard Soyuz TM-7. They left the cassette box on Earth to save weight. The members of Pink Floyd were present at the launch.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\nAll lead vocals performed by David Gilmour unless otherwise noted.\n\n[edit] Disc one\n\n[edit] Side one\n\n1. &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, Pts. 1-5 (David Gilmour, Rick Wright, Roger Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:54\n* Originally from Wish You Were Here\n2. &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; (Gilmour, Anthony Moore, Bob Ezrin, Jon Carin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n* Originally from A Momentary Lapse of Reason\n3. &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; (Gilmour, Patrick Leonard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21\n* Originally from A Momentary Lapse of Reason\n4. &quot;Round and Around&quot; (Gilmour) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:33\n* Originally from A Momentary Lapse of Reason\n* Instrumental\n\n[edit] Side two\n\n1. &quot;Sorrow&quot; (Gilmour) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:28\n* Originally from A Momentary Lapse of Reason\n2. &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (Gilmour, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:19\n* Originally from A Momentary Lapse of Reason\n3. &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; (Gilmour, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:57\n* Originally from A Momentary Lapse of Reason\n\n[edit] Disc two (LP format)\n\n[edit] Side three\n\n1. &quot;One of These Days&quot; (Gilmour, Wright, Nick Mason, Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16\n* Originally from Meddle\n* Instrumental aside from Nick Mason's spoken line, &quot;One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces&quot;\n2. &quot;Time&quot; (Gilmour, Wright, Mason, Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n* Originally from The Dark Side of the Moon\n* Lead vocals: Gilmour and Wright\n3. &quot;Money&quot; (Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:52\n* Originally from The Dark Side of the Moon\n4. &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot; (Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n* Originally from The Wall'\n\n[edit] Side four\n\n1. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (Gilmour, Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n* Originally from Wish You Were Here'\n2. &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; (Gilmour) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:56\n* Originally from The Wall\n3. &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; (Gilmour, Waters) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:12\n* Originally from The Wall\n* Lead vocals: Gilmour and Guy Pratt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce3676808ad5a0ff3eb777b014013bfa9a8ac873","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd--Delicate+Sound+of+Thunder--vikingsfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce3676808ad5a0ff3eb777b014013bfa9a8ac873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,54,118,128,138,213,160,255,62,183,119,176,20,1,59,250,154,138,200,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
