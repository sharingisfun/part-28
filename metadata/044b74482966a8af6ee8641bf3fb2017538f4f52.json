Of course growing up in the 60s meant you had to be affected by the brilliant soul music coming out of Memphis and soon Mighty Mo started his own soul band the Rocketeers while in high school but by college started the Maurice Rodgers Combo. He quit college and headed to Los Angeles and started performing, recording as a session player where he gigged with T-Bone Walker, Albert Collins, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Jimmy Reed, and many others. He played Farfasa organ on Brenton Wood's 1967 hit &quot;Gimme Little Sign&quot;. He also served as a producer, most notably on Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee's classic 1973 A &amp; M record &quot;Sonny And Brownie&quot;.He selected the material, which featured three of his own compositions, rounded up John Mayall, Arlo Guthrie, John Hammond, Michael Franks, Sugarcane Harris and others as backing musicians.
