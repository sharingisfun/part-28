Nick Farmer is a thirty-five-year-old bond trader with Bear Stearns clearing seven figures a year. The novelty of a work-related nightlife centering on liquor, hookers, and cocaine has long since worn thin, though Nick remains keenly addicted to his annual bonus. But the lifestyle is taking a toll on his marriage and on him.\n\nWhen a nerdy analyst approaches him with apocalyptic prognostications of where BearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-flying mortgage-backed securities trading may lead, Nick is presented with the kind of ethical dilemma heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent a lifetime avoiding. Throw in a hot financial journalist who seems to be more interested in him than in the percolating financial armageddon and the prospect that his own wife may have found a new romantic interest of her own, and you have the recipe for NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal and professional implosion.\n\nBy turns hilarious and harrowing, Ghosts of Manhattan follows a winning but flawed character as he struggles to find the right path in a complicated urban heart of darkness.\n\n---\n\nPDF\n\nGet a fast response on your book requests at the TPB forum: \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f69ecbdfd16ebeca225b9da152d917c1c1ebccf","amp;dn":"Ghosts+of+Manhattan+by+Brunt+%28req%3Asuprbay%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f69ecbdfd16ebeca225b9da152d917c1c1ebccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,105,236,189,253,22,235,236,162,37,185,218,21,45,145,124,28,30,188,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
