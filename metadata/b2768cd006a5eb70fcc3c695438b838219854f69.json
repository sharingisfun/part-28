Fusing Death Metal rhythms , progressive song layering, old school thrash riffs, and a punk attitude, REIGN is a sonic force to be reckoned with.\n \nThroughout 2013 they built an underground following, gained a reputation for high energy shows and toured the midwest (without any recorded material!).\n\n In 2014 REIGN released a single, &quot;New World Order&quot;(DEMO) , a music video and a full length EP is to follow. Stay tuned! \n\n\n\nArtist: Reign\n\nTitle: Weapons Of Mass Destruction [EP]\n\nYear: 2015\nGenre: Thrash Metal\n\nOrigin: USA\n\nSize/Quality: 54 mb | Mp3, CBR 320 kbps\nReverbNation\n\n\n\n\nThe Tracks!\n\n01.
