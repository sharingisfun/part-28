The group consists of the Kangol Kid (Shiller Shaun Fequiere), the Educated Rapper (Jeffrey Campbell) (also known as EMD), Doctor Ice (Fred Reeves), and Mix Master Ice (Maurice Bailey). The group's best-known single is &quot;Roxanne, Roxanne,&quot; a widely acclaimed and hip-hop classic, which created a sensation on the hip-hop scene soon after it was released and inspired numerous answer records, most notably by Marley Marl's protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©e Roxanne ShantÃƒÂ©. &quot;Roxanne, Roxanne&quot; was originally the B-side of the lesser-known single &quot;Hangin' Out.&quot;[1] Because of personal issues, the Educated Rapper was absent for its second effort, Skeezer Pleezer (1986), which produced one notable track with the song &quot;Split Personality.&quot; In 2008, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roxanne, RoxanneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was ranked number 84 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. Kangol Kid and Doctor Ice met as dancers for Whodini (Ice is Jalil's younger brother) prior to the formation of UTFO in 1983 in Brooklyn, New York. In 1984, the group signed with Fred Munao's Select Records, and, in the same year, it released its hit single &quot;Roxanne Roxanne.&quot; The group's debut album was produced by R&amp;B group Full Force. According to VH1, the group is still active today.\n\n\nThe members of UTFO were the first break dancers to appear on The Phil Donahue Show. \n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n01. Mo' Bass\n02.
