Each new concept is explained in depth, followed by an example of the idea in practice, usually taken from grandmaster play. It delves deeper into the principles of good chess, explaining how there is an underlying meta-principle concerning the deeper laws of co-operation between pieces.\nBill Hartston, the author, is an experienced and well-known International Master and writes the daily chess column in The Independent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b99655a99a13f22115b9f074ec97a123530c5a31","amp;dn":"Hartston+-+Teach+Yourself+Better+Chess.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b99655a99a13f22115b9f074ec97a123530c5a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,150,85,169,154,19,242,33,21,185,240,116,236,151,161,35,83,12,90,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
