These shows may well represent some of best of Elvis Presley live in the 70s. The Nov. 11th, 1970 recording really captures the raw excitement and electricity of those early tours. Elvis delivers a high octane performance that drives the audience in a frenzy. In parts he sounds a bit unfocused, but overall both Elvis and his audience are having such a ball that any criticisms of his performance are nothing more than nitpicking. The April 27, 1973 concert in the same city may well be his best show of the year, and is a serious contender for &quot;Elvis' best concert performance in the 70's&quot;. Compared to the '70 show, his performance here is tighter, more focused and far more varied. Elvis is vocally strong and he delivers the goods in a knock-out performance.\n\n Both shows were first released by the Live Archives label (1991) using slightly incomplete and inferior sounding copies of original Rick Rennie tapes. Memory Records issued those shows in 2004 (Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ON THE ROAD AGAINÃ¢â‚¬Å“ and Ã¢â‚¬Å¾SHINING IN PORTLANDÃ¢â‚¬Å“ CDs). Those Memory Records releases were engineered and mastered using now obsolete hardware and software. 10 years have passed, and it is right time for the ultimate re-release of these special recordings - in a new, crisp, dynamic sound. Straight ArrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release of the November 11th, 1970 show appears - for the first time - totally complete. The Opening Vamp and the famous &quot;Elvis has left the building&quot; announcement at the end of show were restored. The 1970 show is taken directly from the original stereo master tape. The 1973 show is taken from better of two existing 1st generation copies made back in 70s (the master tape got lost thru the years). Original tape transfers made in March 2004 have been used. Every second was digitally restored from scratch to achieve optimal listening pleasure. Ask your local dealer for samples. As with every Straight ArrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release, this beautifully designed double-digipack edition is limited to 500 copies. If you enjoyed Ã¢â‚¬Å¾A NEW DECADE, A NEW SOUNDÃ¢â‚¬Å“, you will enjoy &quot;LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE IN PORTLAND!&quot; too. These shows never sounded better! \n\nThanks to a Blog!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a27e09189c561673c3faec5a3bc9625bad43a9","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Lightning+strikes+twice+in+Portland+-2cd-+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a27e09189c561673c3faec5a3bc9625bad43a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,162,126,9,24,156,86,22,115,195,250,236,90,59,201,98,91,173,67,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
