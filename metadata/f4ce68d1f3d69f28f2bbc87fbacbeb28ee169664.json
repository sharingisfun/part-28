Part II describes the major neuroscience methods and the computational modeling of attention. Part III looks at three major components of attention from the cognitive neuroscience perspective: selection, vigilance, and control. Finally, part IV discusses the application of findings from the previous sections to the analysis of normal and abnormal development and to pathologies of attention such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorders.\n\nBOOK:\nAUTHOR: Raja Parasuraman\nPUBLISHER: The MIT Press\nRELEASE DATE: July 31, 2000\nLANGUAGE: English\nPAGES: 589\nISBN-10: 0262661128\nISBN-13: 9780262661126\n\nSCAN:\nFORMAT: PDF\nQUALITY: HQ (300DPI)\nOCR: ClearScan (300DPI)\nSIZE: 33.3 MBs\n*All sizes in decimal format.\n\nABOUT THIS TORRENT:\n- Please enable DHT AND PEX\n- Download at will, but please be a good leech and help seed if you can!\n\nAll my releases are scanned/ripped by myself.\nGET A LIFE COPYCAT-LAMERS!
