Yet one lawman remains a steadfast moral compass for the people: WYATT EARP. Earp has collared more most-wanted men than anyone in history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but after a violent assignment claims the life of his brother, Wyatt sets out to forge a simple life in the only boomtown left: Las Vegas. With gorgeous women and free-flowing money on endless tap, Sin City attracts more people than a modern gold rush. Though Earp no longer wears a U.S. MarshallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s badge, his past is about to catch up to him. With nearly everything to lose, Earp will have to beat the odds stacked against him in order to bring old-fashioned justice to Sin City.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Surrogates + Flesh and Bone &amp; Case Files:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9514043&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9514043&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Tale of Sand | (Jim Henson) [GN]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9273041&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9273041&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAny questions?
