You're like some Roman dude and you go around hitting stuff. Made by the same guy behind Angvik. Ain't nothing to write home about, but I'm sure someone'll dig it. Just unpack it and GOO!!\n--------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\nAn action platformer! Soundtrack by Ben Pettengill. Released July 2010.\n\n&quot;Arvoesine is a tough NES-style platformer in which you play a Roman soldier, throwing spears and swiping your sword at the enemy.\nThe protagonist can throw spears in an arc at oncoming enemies, and make them eat his blade if they get too close. For baddies which fire projectiles, his trusty shield comes into play. Don't be fooled by how easy it looks in the above video - that's just Tim being stupidly good at games. It's actually pretty difficult, as games arguably were in the age of the NES.\nThe enemies are pretty abstract - I swear that blue running baddie is a Squirtle - although the boss battles fit the scene, with mythological gods raining lightning bolts down on the player. It's got a soundtrack produced by Mr. Ben 'Pgil' Pettengill, too.&quot;\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Absolutely 100% clean and working!*\n*My upload ain't the best, but I'll seed this forever!*\n*BUY the games you reallllly dig!!!*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f76267c08a8a3142844f8f732b711de0e6e15b1","amp;dn":"Arvoesine+1.3b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f76267c08a8a3142844f8f732b711de0e6e15b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,118,38,124,8,168,163,20,40,68,248,247,50,183,17,222,14,110,21,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
