So please don't complain about resolution, no surround sound etc. This was the best quality I managed to get when I ripped it..\n\nIt's probably the best Iggy/Stooges documentary I've seen-so far. Even Scott Ashton gets to say a few words.\n\nR.I.P Ron Ashton ----&gt; In my opinion, one of the most underated guitar players in history. Why, you might ask..Can he play like Steve Vai, or the hobbit (don't know his name# in Dream Theater for instance? \n\nNope, and I don't think he ever gave a flying fuck about techniques,or melodic guitar solo's either. \n\nFunhouse sounds today #almost 40 years after it was released)still &quot;fresh&quot;,- almost &quot;modern&quot;#I'm talking about the production#. When I was young and first heard:&quot;Down on the street&quot;, &quot;Loose&quot;, &quot;1970&quot;, Tv Eye&quot;- It totally blew my mind, and even today I get goosebumps when I play the cd. It's so brilliant in all it's simplicity,but yet impossible to duplicate.\n\nIggy often gets all the credits for &quot;creating punk&quot; alone. Let's not forget that Ron #and later James Williamson#created most of the riffs-which leads me back to why I think Ron Ashton is truly a &quot;Guitar hero extraordinaire&quot;. He came up with the riff to &quot;No fun&quot; ,1970, Tv Eye, I got a right, 1969, Real cool time, Loose etc, etc. In my book, that's way more important than playing scales up and down the guitar neck as fast as possible.\nI rest my case.. ;-)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nI'll be uploading more Iggy/Stooges shows later btw.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5703338805332406c2e5040a1f6ed8870de9451","amp;dn":"Iggy+Pop+Documentary-+VH1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5703338805332406c2e5040a1f6ed8870de9451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,112,51,56,128,83,50,64,108,46,80,64,161,246,237,136,112,222,148,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
