Big Cats is a visionary producer and multi-instrumentalist who has worked with Sage Francis, P.O.S., TTxBC and others. Together, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve crafted an album brimming with substantive punchlines, gallows humor and a down-to-earth political edge, all over some of the most gorgeously banging production of the year. Featuring indie-rap visionaries like Toki Wright, Crescent Moon (of Kill the Vultures), Kristoff Krane and more, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Better WeaponizeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of the tightest, smartest, most singular projects ever to emerge from the lauded Twin Cities underground hip hop scene. \n\nSee the music video for &quot;To Young Leaders&quot; here: \ncredits\nreleased 06 November 2012 \n\nAll beats by Big Cats - www.bigcatsbeats.net \nAll words (except guest appearances) by Guante - www.guante.info \nCover designed by Big Cats \nKnife-Girl CD design by Simi Kang \nContact:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906c0e9c0562cf0493132ce7d33953a8e81f2c45","amp;dn":"Guante+%26amp%3B+Big+Cats+-+YOU+BETTER+WEAPONIZE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906c0e9c0562cf0493132ce7d33953a8e81f2c45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,108,14,156,5,98,207,4,147,19,44,231,211,57,83,168,232,31,44,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
