Aesop's Fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for various entertainments, especially children's plays and cartoons.\n\nNothing was known about Aesop from credible records. The tradition was that he was at one point freed from slavery and that he eventually died at the hands of Delphians. In fact, the obscurity shrouding his life has led some scholars to deny his existence altogether.\n\nHis most famous fable in America is a parable of the tortoise and the hare. In this story, a rabbit challenges a tortoise to a race. The rabbit is sure of its victory and as a result, depending on the version of the story, in some way completes the race slower than the turtle. Often, the hare takes a nap or takes too many breaks. The persistent tortoise, despite being slower, wins because it persevered.\n\n--\n\nAesop's Fables or Aesopica refers to a collection of fables credited to Aesop. Aesop's Fables has also become a blanket term for collections of brief fables, usually involving personified animals.\n\nThe fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today. Many stories included in Aesop's Fables, such as The Fox and the Grapes (from which the idiom &quot;sour grapes&quot; was derived), The Tortoise and the Hare and The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf (also known as The Boy Who Cried Wolf), are well-known throughout the world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more free Audio and ebooks visit: http://www.opencast.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:617eb8b78c1d81fc06e2ecb99633b0cbf76e4e5a","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Aesop%5C%27s+fables+%28+www.opencast.de+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"617eb8b78c1d81fc06e2ecb99633b0cbf76e4e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,126,184,183,140,29,129,252,6,226,236,185,150,51,176,203,247,110,78,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
