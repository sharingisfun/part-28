However, nothing shows up on radar, and one of the jets is lost during the action. MacAfee is regarded as a dangerous crackpot until other incidents and disappearances convince the authorities that the threat is real. Some believe it is a French-Canadian folk legend come to life, but it turns out to be an extraterrestrial giant bird composed of anti-matter whose disregard for human life and architecture threatens the world.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06427c755e968a0debe2b8eac129dd6f5ed614ce","amp;dn":"The+Giant+Claw+%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06427c755e968a0debe2b8eac129dd6f5ed614ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,66,124,117,94,150,138,13,235,226,184,234,193,41,221,111,94,214,20,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
