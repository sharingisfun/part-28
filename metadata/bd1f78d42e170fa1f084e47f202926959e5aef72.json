But William Tyndale, the young Gloucestershire tutor who wrote them, paid for them with his life. He was persecuted, exiled and eventually burned at the stake.\n\nBook of Fire is the thrilling, moving story of the man who first translated the word of God into the English vernacular. Tyndale did so in defiance of church and state, hunted by the implacable enmity and the agents of the sainted Thomas More. He was finally betrayed, but by then his courage and poetic instinct had provided the backbone of the single most significant work in the English language. The Tudor heretic had changed the literary, religious and political landscape for ever.\n\nAbout the Author\nBrian Moynahan worked as a journalist for the YORKSHIRE POST and THE TIMES and currently works for several British and American newspapers. He is the author of THE BRITISH CENTURY, THE RUSSIAN CENTURY, and A BIOGRAPHY OF RASPUTIN.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1f78d42e170fa1f084e47f202926959e5aef72","amp;dn":"Tyndale+-+The+Bloody+Birth+of+the+English+Bible+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1f78d42e170fa1f084e47f202926959e5aef72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,31,120,212,46,23,15,161,240,132,228,127,32,41,38,149,158,90,239,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
