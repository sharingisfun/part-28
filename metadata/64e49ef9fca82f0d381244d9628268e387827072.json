First, I pulled all the 5.1 audio off and coverted it to 2.0 16/44.1. I used the 5.1 because the sample rate was higher than the stereo. \n\nAfter it was in stereo I removed all the chatter and noise from between songs, added 1 sec of silence and fade to the begining and end of each track (not affecting the music at all) so that the editing between tracks would not be noticible. I then increased the track volume to 0dB (the loudest a CD can reproduce without creating noise or clipping) and then converted to FLAC.\n\nThe result, if you burn to CD, is a perfect, live representation of St. Anger.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e49ef9fca82f0d381244d9628268e387827072","amp;dn":"Metallica+St.+Anger+Live+in+Studio+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e49ef9fca82f0d381244d9628268e387827072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,228,158,249,252,168,47,13,56,18,68,217,98,130,104,227,135,130,112,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
