Though the girl believes the boy healed her, in reality the boy has no such powers. The father of the boy fools the village folk into believing he's a healer, but ultimately the sham is exposed, causing the village to revolt against the boy and his family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7acdd54502bbb8c714102965443644f0ecd9907","amp;dn":"The+Line+of+Destiny+aka+Rekava+%281956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7acdd54502bbb8c714102965443644f0ecd9907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,172,221,84,80,43,187,140,113,65,2,150,84,67,100,79,14,205,153,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
