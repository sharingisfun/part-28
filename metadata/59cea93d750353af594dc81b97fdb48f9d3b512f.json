He also explains how the nuke strike threat may be a clever distraction keeping us from focusing on the accelerating disintegration of liberties at home, and how it can ultimately be used to usher in World War 3. \n\nAlex will also analyze how senators weren't allowed to read SB 49 prior to cloture, and how DARPA is helping develop robots that Ã¢â‚¬ËœthinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ like a human brain. \n\nOn the show today, Alex welcomes primetime anchor at WXIX Fox 19 in Cincinnati and investigative journalist Ben Swann to discuss his courageous work in questioning and exposing controversial news items.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
