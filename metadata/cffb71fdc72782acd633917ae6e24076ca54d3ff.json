Had some feeling that 1400 was a little bit low but after trying diffrent settings I think I managed to get it quite good. Included all subtitles except greek and hebrew, had no clue how to convert that to a SRT. There is a french audiotrack that I can upload if anyone wants it.\n\nSettings I used (x264 v1114): --ref 5 --bframes 4 --b-adapt 2 --direct auto --nf --subme 7 --trellis 2 --partitions p8x8,b8x8,i4x4,i8x8 --8x8dct --me umh --threads auto --progress --sar 16:11 --no-psnr --no-ssim --output\n\nThere was a 1 pixel black bar at bottom and left, but I cropped it out.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cffb71fdc72782acd633917ae6e24076ca54d3ff","amp;dn":"The.Mists.of.Avalon.PAL.DVD.x264.AC3-DOOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cffb71fdc72782acd633917ae6e24076ca54d3ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,251,113,253,199,39,130,172,214,51,145,122,230,226,64,118,202,84,211,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
