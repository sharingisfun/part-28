The story opens with Bruce Wayne discovering he's been voted out of Wayne Enterprises in the wake of the Vesper Fairchild murder scandal. That's not the least of his problems, though, as a new vigilante known as the Tracker is intruding on the Batman's turf, making life even more difficult for the crime bosses of Gotham. But unbeknownst to Batman, the appearances of a new vigilante and a new villain called the Suicide King are just the beginning, as another shadowy figure is behind it all - a figure who plans to bring Gotham to its knees.\n\nWritten by John Francis Moore. The first six issues were illustrated by Stefano Gaudiano and Rick Hoberg. Steve Lieber replaced Hoeberg on issues seven and eight.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd697d7e3ab7da265ad9a97a2d79f104ec5983b4","amp;dn":"Batman+-+Family+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd697d7e3ab7da265ad9a97a2d79f104ec5983b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,105,125,126,58,183,218,38,90,217,169,122,45,121,241,4,236,89,131,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
