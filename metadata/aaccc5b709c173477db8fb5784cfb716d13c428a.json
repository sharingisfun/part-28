The story is simple, yet the implications of its characters emotions and actions are profound. When a young hitchhiker joins a couple on a weekend yacht trip, psychological warfare breaks out as the two men compete for the womans attention. A storm forces the small crew below deck, and tension builds to a violent climax. With stinging dialogue and a mercilessly probing camera, Polanski creates a disturbing study of fear, humiliation, sexuality, and aggression. This remarkable directorial debut won Polanski worldwide acclaim, a place on the cover of Time, and his first Oscar nomination.\n\n*** THE BEST WAY TO MESSAGE ME IS TO COMMENT ON MY LATEST UPLOAD, I AM GETTING TOO MANY UP THERE TO MONITOR ALL OF THEM. ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaccc5b709c173477db8fb5784cfb716d13c428a","amp;dn":"Knife+in+the+Water%3A+Disc+1+The+Film+%281962%29+FULL+DVD+9+%28ISO%29+Crit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaccc5b709c173477db8fb5784cfb716d13c428a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,204,197,183,9,193,115,71,125,184,251,87,132,207,183,22,209,60,66,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
