He is best known for the number one single, &quot;Tell Laura I Love Her&quot;, which sold over a million copies in 1960.\nRay Peterson's original version of &quot;Tell Laura I Love Her&quot; was considered for release in the United Kingdom. Thousands of copies were pressed but someone at Decca Records decided that the song was in &quot;bad taste&quot;, and the records were ordered destroyed. EMI subsequently arranged for Valence to cover the song, which was co-written by Jeff Barry.Valance thus became the first Welshman to reach the top spot - Shirley Bassey being the first Welsh person.\n\n\nTrack listing\n \n1.
