But as the young Taggerung grows, he rebels against his destiny and goes off in search of the place he was born-a home he can barely remember. Tagg is pursued by a member of Sawney's clan, out to destroy the deserter and claim the title of Taggerung. Is the otter the Taggerung after all? And if he is not, who is he?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c568a12d942d043065ba4eb34c7a9040c433eb14","amp;dn":"Jacques%2C+Brian+-+%5BRedwall+14%5D+-+Taggerung-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c568a12d942d043065ba4eb34c7a9040c433eb14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,104,161,45,148,45,4,48,101,186,78,179,76,122,144,64,196,51,235,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
