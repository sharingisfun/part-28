The most recent\n        changes can be found on the latest news page. \n\n\n        Whats New?\n\n        mIRC 7.36 has been released! (August 14th 2014) \n\n        This is a small update that addresses a number of issues reported\n        by users since the last release. It includes improvements,\n        changes and fixes to a number of features, including: \n\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed slow mark/copy text in windows that contain long lines.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed listbox lines in Options dialog and other windows being\n          chopped when DPI settings are set to a high value.\n        Ã‚Â· Reverted change to alias/identifiers that caused a script to be\n          halted with a recursion error warning.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed listbox with checkboxes bug that caused checkboxes to be\n          checked if you scrolled through them with the up/down keys.\n        Ã‚Â· Changed channel folder dialog so that it can now be resized.\n        Ã‚Â· Changed online timer dialog to display information more\n          clearly.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed Shift+Tab beeping when switching to listbox in channel\n          window.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed $fullscreen not working on a non-primary monitor.\n        Ã‚Â· Updated the find/replace dialogs in the script editor to\n          remember their positions for the current mIRC session.\n        Ã‚Â· Updated mIRC to include OpenSSL support without needing\n          external DLLS.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed lock dialog bug that caused mIRC to ask for a password if\n          the on startup option was enabled without setting a password.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed $input() 'b' switch so that the dialog window close\n          button is also temporarily disabled.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed isignore only accepting types, now also accepts switches.\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed CAP server-time time value not being used when\n          timestamping an event in the log file.\n        Ã‚Â· Other changes and bug fixes. \n\n        In total there have been around 25 changes since the last release\n        and although most of them are only small fixes and tweaks, we\n        hope that they result in a more useful and stable mIRC for you. \n\n\n\n        IMPORTANT NOTICE:\n\n        As of 09/14/2013 ALL TE RAR archives will now be using the RAR5\n        standard.  Please make sure to update to the latest version of\n        Winrar (at least Winrar v5.0) so you can extract the contents of\n        the *.001, *.002 etc... archives within the zip files.

After installation copy precracked exe from\n        the Crack folder to the installed folder of mIRC.  Launch mIRC\n        and use ANY information for registration.  You now have a fully\n        activated version of mIRC!  This version is also compatible with\n        the fish_10, just make sure you install the latest version of\n        fish_10.\n\n\n        IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PORTABLE INSTALL:\n\n        If you choose to make a portable install while doing the\n        installation its important to note that the registration info is\n        then stored in mIRC.ini on your portable device.  If you copy\n        over your mIRC.ini from your Windows Program Files/User\n        installation of mIRC, then when you launch mIRC it will ask for a\n        key again (if you have entered one before) because this time it\n        started to look in your registry.\n\n        Either don't copy your old ini over, or make sure to find, then\n        copy and paste the [user] section from the portable version ini\n        into your old ini you plan on using.\n\n        Thats it!
