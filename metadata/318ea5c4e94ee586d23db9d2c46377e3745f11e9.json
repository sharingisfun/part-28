They are organized according to utility, i.e. Audio/Video, CD-DVD Image Programs, Educational, Emulation, File/Disk Management, Games, Internet, Office, Programming, Security (biggest folder) etc... It would take a ridiculously long time to explain each program in there as there are over 12 thousand files on it. The security folder alone would be insane. \n\nAlso please note that programs from the security folder will be flagged as dangerous by most antiviral programs. These are not viruses but can be dangerous if used incorrectly. They are security tools that can be used to test a system&amp;#039;s security (for example, port-scanners, registry password recovery tools, file-binders etc). Please use at your own discretion. \n\n- NemesisCocytus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318ea5c4e94ee586d23db9d2c46377e3745f11e9","amp;dn":"USB+Toolkit+%2812000%2B+files%29.+No+install+needed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318ea5c4e94ee586d23db9d2c46377e3745f11e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,142,165,196,233,78,229,134,210,61,185,210,196,99,119,227,116,95,17,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
