She initially intends to kill the infant, but then changes her mind. Years later, her daughter Carrie, a shy, unassertive girl, nears her graduation from Ewen High School in Maine.\nWhile showering after gym class at school, Carrie experiences her first menstrual period. She naively thinks she is bleeding to death. The other girls laugh and tease her. Longtime bully, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) records the event on her Smartphone and uploads it to YouTube. Gym teacher Miss Desjardin (Judy Greer) comforts Carrie and sends her home with Margaret, who believes menstruation is a sexual sin. Margaret demands that Carrie abstain from showering with the others. When Carrie refuses, Margaret hits her with a Bible and locks her in her &quot;prayer closet&quot;. As Carrie screams to be let out, a crack appears on the door, and the crucifix in the closet begins to bleed.\nMiss Desjardin informs the girls who teased Carrie that they will endure boot-camp style detention for their behavior. When Chris refuses, she is suspended from school and banned from the prom. She storms out, vowing revenge.\nCarrie learns that she has telekinesis, the ability to move things with her mind. She researches her abilities, learning to harness them. Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) regrets teasing Carrie in the shower room and attempts to make amends by asking her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort), to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts Tommy's invitation. When she tells her mother, Margaret forbids Carrie to attend. Asking her mother to relent, Carrie manifests her telekinesis. Margaret believes this power comes from the Devil and is proof that Carrie has been corrupted by sin.\nChris, her boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell), and his friends plan revenge on Carrie. They kill a pig and drain its blood into a bucket. Margaret tries to prevent Carrie from going to the prom, but Carrie telekinetically locks her mother in the closet. At the prom, Carrie is nervous and shy, but Tommy kindly puts her at ease. As part of Chris and Billy's plan, fake ballots name Carrie and Tommy prom queen and king.\nAt home, Sue receives a text from Chris taunting her about her revenge on Carrie. Sue drives to the prom, arriving just as Carrie and Tommy are about to be crowned. Sue sees the bucket of pig's blood dangling above Carrie but, before she can warn anyone, Miss Desjardin hustles her out, suspecting that Sue is planning to humiliate Carrie.\nChris dumps the bucket of pig's blood onto Carrie and Tommy. The bucket falls onto Tommy's head, killing him. Chris's shower video appears on large screens above the stage, inciting laughter from some in the audience. Enraged, Carrie unleashes her rage telekinetically, killing several of the students and staff (except for Miss Desjardin). A fire breaks out and, as the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away, leaving a trail of fire and destruction in her wake. Chris and Billy attempt to flee in Billy's car. Chris urges Billy to run Carrie over, but Carrie flips the car into a gas station, setting the gas station on fire, and killing them.\nCarrie arrives home and she and Margaret embrace. Margaret tells Carrie about the night of Carrie's conception. After having shared a bed platonically with her husband, they yielded to temptation one night and, after praying for strength, Carrie's father &quot;took&quot; Margaret, who enjoyed the experience. Margaret attacks Carrie, who attempts to flee but kills her with several sharp tools. She becomes hysterical and makes stones rain from the sky to crush the house. When Sue arrives, a furious Carrie grabs her with her powers, but senses something inside Sue, and tells her that her baby is a girl. Carrie pushes a stunned Sue out of the house to safety as the house collapses and apparently kills the Whites.\nAs a voice-over gives her testimony in court regarding the prom incident, Sue visits Carrie's grave and places a single white rose by the headstone. As she leaves, the gravestone's surface begins to break and Carrie's voice is heard.\n\n\nEnjoy !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68561bb35bb4b91c019212d25c73fc59c87affb8","amp;dn":"Carrie+2013.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68561bb35bb4b91c019212d25c73fc59c87affb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,86,27,179,91,180,185,28,1,146,18,210,92,115,252,89,200,122,255,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
