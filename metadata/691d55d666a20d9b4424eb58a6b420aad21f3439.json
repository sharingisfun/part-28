This fascinating &quot;fly on the wall&quot; documentary shot mainly on tour in the late '60s includes songs performed in many different settings, plus unique footage of Cash relaxing and visiting with riends and family.\n\nLegendary country singer and songwriter Johnny Cash was just beginning to break through to a new level of mainstream recognition with the success of his classic Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison album when filmmaker Robert Elfstrom spent several months on the road with Cash, attempting to capture both the public and private sides of the man. Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music was the result, a profile of the artist which includes visits to the sharecropping farms where Cash spent his childhood; a recording session with Cash and Bob Dylan; reminiscences of growing up in the rural South from Johnny and his friend Carl Perkins; concerts in penitentiaries and Indian reservations; Cash bantering with his wife, June Carter Cash, and reuniting with his family; and performances of a number of his best-known songs. Originally produced for British television, Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music pleased Cash enough that he later hired director Elfstrom to helm his film about Jesus Christ in the Holy Lands, The Gospel Road.\n\n\n01-Ring of Fire (concert recording).\n02-Land of Israel.\n03-Folsom Prison Blues (concert recording). \n04-Five Feet High And Rising (concert recording). \n05-Foggy Mountain Top-Carter Family (concert recording). \n06-Blue Suede Shoes-Carl Perkins (concert recording). \n07-Remember the Alamo (concert recording). \n08-Buttering Biscuit Uo Tonight-???
