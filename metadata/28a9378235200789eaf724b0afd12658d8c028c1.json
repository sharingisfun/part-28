Altough it is called &quot;Documentary&quot;, it isnt really a documentary, but it may suddently become one. It is about two friends roaming around the streets of SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, discussing their lack of money, their\nbored days and most of all their will to see a movie. After many refferences to Saraceni, Fuller, Lester, Welles, Reed and many others, which shows both the characters' and Sganzerla's love for cinema, they end up not seeing anything and they start to discuss (without audio/video synch) the movie we are watching, and the difficulty they had in making it. This is a movie on the borderline between fiction and documentary, and deeply metalinguistic: a film about movies and about making movies (including itself).by amoeba\n\nDocumentario - File Size : 140 Mb.\nDuration : 00:10:16\n[Video] Resolution : 512x384 Codec : XviD MPEG-4 codec FPS : 23.976 BitRate : 1792 Kbps\n[Audio] Codec : 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3 Number of channels : 2 chnls 48000Hz 125 kb/s total\n\nBrasil, 1981\n\nA musical journey trough Brazil, centering on JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Gilberto and the recordings of his 1981 homonymous album. But as it is expected from Sganzerla, this is not a typical documentary. The director seems to gather images sugested by JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Gilberto's music, which makes him travel through Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, the recording studio, Joe Carioca's movies (link) and Orson Welles images on Brazil (one of Sganzerla's obsessions). No audio/video synch, no dialogue, only images poetic and three songs: &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; (by Ary Barroso), &quot;Bahia com H&quot; (by Denis Brean) and &quot;No Tabuleiro da Baiana&quot; (by Ary Barroso), sung by JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Gilberto, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Maria BetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢nia. by amoeba\n\nBrasil - File Size : 179 Mb.\nDuration : 00:13:07\n[Video] Resolution : 592 x 448 Codec : XviD MPEG-4 codec FPS : 29.971 BitRate : 1783 Kbps\n[Audio] Codec : 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3 Number of channels : 2 chnls 48000Hz 125 kb/s total\n\nPerigo Negro, 1993\n\nFilmed at the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro, a fan narrates the trajectory of a soccer player. Perigo Negro was a great athlete with a highly unusual and personal soccer style. Yet, despite his sports genius on the field, he never attained financial success or the idolatry of the crowd.
