Hi again folks. This upload is not the same exact fileset that Alzeppelin originally shared with the trading community. Along with full tagging, this fileset also has the DC offset correction done and, in some instances, track edit points were moved to a better location. This has full checksums and a complete set of artwork to go with this truly fantastic Neil Young collectable. Enjoy...\n\nNeil Young with Crazy Horse\nUnited Center\nChicago, IL\nOctober 11, 2012\n\nTaper: Alzeppelin\n\nLocation: Section 204 Club Level\n\nGear: Coresound CSB Mics - Bass Roll-off box - Tascam DR-2D 16/44\n\nTransfer: Tascam DR-2D - USB - Cooledit Pro (EQ and Normalize levels) - CDWav - Traders Little Helper - FLAC Level 8\n\n\nNotes: I traveled 500 miles solo to see Neil and the Horse since there are unfortunately no dates yet announced for the upper Midwest. Great, great show with the world premiere of a song tentatively called &quot;Singer Without A Song&quot;.  \nI am very pleased with the sound quality considering my location in the arena. \nThis recording is a testament to Neil's excellent sound crew.\nMy taping location was perfect since you can only hear an occasional clap in the distance with no talking whatsoever. The only voice you will hear is my reaction to hearing the first few bass notes of &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot;. I was hoping he would encore with it and, sure enough, he did. Enjoy!\n\n\n\nSetlist:\n\n01 Star Spangled Banner\n02 Love And Only Love\n03 Powderfinger\n04 Born In Ontario\n05 Walk Like A Giant\n06 The Needle And The Damage Done\n07 Twisted Road\n08 Singer Without A Song\n09 Ramada Inn\n10 Cinnamon Girl\n11 Fuckin' Up\n12 Mr. Soul\n13 Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)\n14 Tonight's The Night\n\n\n\nRecommended disc break is after track 9\n\n\nPhotos used in artwork taken by E.
