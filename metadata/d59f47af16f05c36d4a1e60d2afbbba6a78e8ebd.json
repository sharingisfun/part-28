They needed music to support their video and contacted Brian Dougans. They sent a demo video tape containing graphics and some music to Morgan Khan who (although didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t appreciate the video) invited Brian Dougans to record 2 demos at his Dance Studios in Ealing London. He probably made use of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer. The Evil Otto sample ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHumanoidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the videogame Berzerk provided the name of the track.\n\nThe track was originally called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHumanoidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to be put out by Stakker through Morgan Khans label Westside Records, though Morgan released it as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStakker HumanoidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHumanoidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to avoid copyright issues. A dispute had arisen between Brian Dougans and Colin Scott / Mark McClean and before the record was in the shops, Stakker and Brian Dougans split, ending their working relationship which had lasted just over a year. However Mark McClean and Brian Dougans were to continue working together on The Future Sound of London project.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d59f47af16f05c36d4a1e60d2afbbba6a78e8ebd","amp;dn":"Stakker+Humanoid+%28FSOL%29+-+Stakker+Humanoid+92+%281992%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d59f47af16f05c36d4a1e60d2afbbba6a78e8ebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,159,71,175,22,240,92,54,212,161,230,13,42,251,187,166,167,142,142,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
