Residues of Pesticides and Other Contaminants in the Total Environment\r\n\r\nISSN: 0179-5953\r\n\r\nReviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology publishes reviews pertaining to the sources, transport, fate and effects of contaminants in the environment. The series provides a place for the publication of critical reviews of the current knowledge and understanding of environmental sciences in order to provide insight into contaminant pathways, fate and behavior in environmental compartments and the possible consequences of their presence, with multidisciplinary contributions from the fields of analytical chemistry, biochemistry, biology, ecology, molecular and cellular biology (in an environmental context), and human, wildlife and environmental toxicology. This book series does not typically consider submissions dealing with technical aspects of occupational exposure and effects in humans, wastewater treatment and effluent characterization, or remediation of contaminated sites. However, submissions addressing one of these topic areas may be considered where there exists a strong link to the receiving environment, and/or the identification of emerging contaminants of concern. All manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field. Reviewers will be asked to consider coverage and critical appraisal of the subject, originality , relevance, and impact to the wider scientific community. Authors writing in a second language are encouraged to have their manuscript corrected by a native English speaker or by a professional editing firm. Abstracts, short communications and notes will not be accepted. Where appropriate, such submissions may be referred to our companion journal, the Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (BECT), while full-length research articles are typically the purview of Archives of Environmental Contaminant and Toxicology (AECT). RECT prefers extended reviews of a length including references of more than 5,000 words, and without an upper word count limit. Reviews of shorter length (i.e. where length including references of less than 5,000 words) which may be suitable for case studies, a focused topic or an applied subject of debate or interest can be submitted to AECT. Authors may directly contact the Editor-in-Chief if they wish to clarify which publication is most suited for their submission.\r\nImpact Factor: 3.744 (2014) *\r\nSubject category &quot;Environmental sciences&quot;: Rank 27 of 221\r\n* Journal Citation ReportsÂ®, Thomson Reuters\r\n\r\nEditor-in-Chief:\r\n\r\nPim de Voogt\r\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\r\n  \r\n\r\nEditorial Assistant:\r\n\r\nHelen Bergman\r\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\r\n  \r\n\r\nEditorial Board:\r\n\r\nMarÃ­a Fernanda Cavieres\r\nUniversity of ValparaÃ­so, ValparaÃ­so, Chile\r\n\r\nColin Janssen\r\nGhent University, Gent, Belgium\r\n\r\nJames B.
