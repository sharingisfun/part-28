Led by Tim Gane and Laetitia Sadier, Stereolab either legitimized forms of music that were on the fringe of rock, or brought attention to strands of pop music -- bossa nova, lounge-pop, movie soundtracks -- that were traditionally banished from the rock lineage. The group's trademark sound -- a droning, hypnotic rhythm track overlaid with melodic, mesmerizing singsong vocals, often sung in French and often promoting revolutionary, Marxist politics -- was deceptively simple, providing the basis for a wide array of stylistic experiments over the course of their prolific career. Throughout it all, Stereolab relied heavily on forgotten methods of recording, whether it was analog synthesizers and electronics or a fondness for hi-fi test records, without ever sinking to the level of kitsch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54555d086fc253b43fb22885ca4c1a34f4b6c98","amp;dn":"Stereolab+-+Oscillons+from+the+Anti-Sun+%28Promo%29+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54555d086fc253b43fb22885ca4c1a34f4b6c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,69,85,208,134,252,37,59,67,251,34,136,92,164,193,163,79,75,108,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
