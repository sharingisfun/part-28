Her ex-husband is getting remarried, her teenage daughter hardly needs her anymore, and the career she once dreamed about has somehow slipped from her grasp. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost lost sight of the spirited and optimistic young woman she used to be.\n\nAs she heads off to a Caribbean island to mark the new decade with her best friends from college, DaphneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in anything but the mood to celebrate. But when she meets Clay Hanson, a much younger man, she ignores her inner voice warning her that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too old for a fling. In fact, this tropical getaway might be the perfect opportunity to picture her future in a new sun-drenched light.\n\nWith the help of her friends, Daphne rediscovers her enthusiasm for life, as well as her love for herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€and realizes that her best years are still ahead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52ffc31dd4da4bc3b9b902c734b480b61a0e4a1","amp;dn":"Wait+For+The+Rain+-+Maria+Murnane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52ffc31dd4da4bc3b9b902c734b480b61a0e4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,47,252,49,221,77,164,188,59,155,144,44,115,75,72,11,97,160,228,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
