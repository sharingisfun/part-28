This rebroadcast was captured with a Yamaha component tuner to wav and encoded with LAME (q0, V1). An announcer talked or played the station logo between tracks 2&amp;3, 5&amp;6 and 7&amp;8, but I cut these 'watermarks' out in a way that hopefully creates the feel of a seamless set.\n \nTotal length: 32 minutes 36 seconds\n\n    Tracks:\n\n          1. The Book I Read (4:42)\n          2. Paper (2:35)\n          3. Mind (4:23)\n          4. Found a Job (4:51)\n          5. Memories (3:44)\n          6. Psycho Killer (6:02)\n          7.
