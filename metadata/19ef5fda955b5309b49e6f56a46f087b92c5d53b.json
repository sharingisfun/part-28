This release 2007 in the 24 bit remastered 'Verve Master Edition' series.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nShortly after returning to the U.S. (following three years in Copenhagen) Stan Getz had a musical reunion with Bob Brookmeyer. As usual the cool-toned tenor blends in very well with the valve trombonist and, backed by a fine rhythm section (pianist Steve Kuhn, bassist John Neves and drummer Roy Haynes), they perform three Brookmeyer pieces (including one titled &quot;Minuet Circa '61&quot;), two standards and Buck Clayton's &quot;Love Jumped Out.&quot; This little-known session is often quite memorable.\n\n01. Minuet Circa '61   \n02. Who Could Care    \n03. Nice Work If You Can Get It    \n04. Thump, Thump, Thump   \n05. A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square  \n06. Love Jumped Out \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ef5fda955b5309b49e6f56a46f087b92c5d53b","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+%26amp%3B+Bob+Brookmeyer+-+Recorded+Fall+1961+%282007+Remast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ef5fda955b5309b49e6f56a46f087b92c5d53b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,239,95,218,149,91,83,9,180,158,111,86,164,111,8,123,146,197,213,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
