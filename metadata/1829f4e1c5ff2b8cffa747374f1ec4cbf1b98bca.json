Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes, Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by Agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barstow, California where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With the help of Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone.\n\nResolution: 672x288\nDuration: 1:47:41\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nData Rate: 1775kbps\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kbps\n\nEnglish Hard Sub\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1829f4e1c5ff2b8cffa747374f1ec4cbf1b98bca","amp;dn":"2Fast2Furious%5B2003%5DDvdrip%5BEng-Hard-Sub%5D-Salem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1829f4e1c5ff2b8cffa747374f1ec4cbf1b98bca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,41,244,225,197,255,43,140,255,167,71,55,79,30,196,203,241,185,139,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
