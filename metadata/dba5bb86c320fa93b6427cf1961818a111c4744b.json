In Own Your Kitchen, Anne Burrell gets you in that groove by sharing the recipes she makes when she's relaxed and cooking at home.\nAnne has designed these 100 recipes to get you comfortable with dozens of essential techniquesÃ¢â‚¬â€like how to create a perfect omelet, how to butterfly a chicken for an easy roast, and how to bake a focaccia to doll up any meal. Along the way, she offers priceless tips: such as what can be made ahead (like her garlic-ginger-soy-citrus marinade that can be used with just about anything or a freezer staple like fish stock) or how to coax flavor out of a chicken with a garlic rubdown.\nThese are recipes that will work every time. And with Anne by your side, reminding you to set up, taste, season, check, and be patient, you'll also get in on the secrets (including tricks for bouncing back from mistakes) that she's picked up over the years in some of the best restaurant kitchens and from working with people trying to be better home cooks, just like you.\nSo, get comfortable in your kitchen. You own it!\n\nAbout the Authors\nAnne Burrell is the New York Times bestselling author of Cook Like a Rock Star.
