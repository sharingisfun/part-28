This world-famous bestseller has withstood the test of time, inspiring countless books and films, including the author's own popular sequel, &quot;The Eyes of the Sphinx.&quot; But here is where it all began--von DÃƒÂ¤ niken's startling theories of our earliest encounters with alien worlds, based upon his lifelong studies of ancient ruins, lost cities, potential spaceports, and a myriad of hard scientific facts that point to extraterrestrial intervention in human history. Most incredible of all, however, is von DÃƒÂ¤ niken's theory that we ourselves are the descendants of these galactic pioneers--and the archeological discoveries that prove it...\n* An alien astronaut preserved in a pyramid\n* Thousand-year-old spaceflight navigation charts\n* Computer astronomy from Incan and Egyptian ruins\n* A map of the land beneath the ice cap of Antarctica\n* A giant spaceport discovered in the Andes\nIncludes remarkable photos that document mankind's first contact with aliens at the dawn of civilization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995ada9cd14793d44c4c3602fbf8bda06b8e8a23","amp;dn":"Chariots+of+the+Gods+by+Erich+von+Daniken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995ada9cd14793d44c4c3602fbf8bda06b8e8a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,90,218,156,209,71,147,212,76,76,54,2,251,248,189,160,107,142,138,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
