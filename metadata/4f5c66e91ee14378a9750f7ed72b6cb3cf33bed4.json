The story is based on Regina Kelly, a victim of Texas police drug enforcement tactics. The film stays fairly close to the details of the actual case, although it changes all the characters' names and takes some liberties with the case's transcripts and other dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on the civil rights lawsuit Regina Kelly v. John Paschall, filed on behalf of 15 African-American residents of Hearne, Texas who were indicted in November 2000 on drug charges after being rounded up in a series of drug sweeps the ACLU referred to as &quot;paramilitary.&quot; The lawsuit accused Paschall and the South Central Texas Narcotics Task Force of conducting racially motivated drug sweeps for more than 15 years in Hearne. In 2005, the ACLU and Robertson County settled and the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the individuals named in the suit, including Paschall.\r\n\r\nClay Kane said that American Violet is &quot;the first must-see film for African-Americans in 2009.&quot; Dr. Joy Browne of WOR Radio reviewed the film, calling it &quot;A gem of a movie. Timely, thought-provoking, passionate, exciting. Everything you look for in a movie experience and more.&quot; Rex Reed of The New York Observer said that the film is &quot;a rich, vibrant narrative film guaranteed to move everyone who sees it.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three stars and commented that &quot;Nicole Beharie delivers a stunning performance.&quot;\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nPlease check out other movies, documentaries, Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Gotham, DC Comics, and more at:\r  https://thepiratebay.org/user/bsg4you/ \r  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/ \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5c66e91ee14378a9750f7ed72b6cb3cf33bed4","amp;dn":"American+Violet+2008+1080p+6ch-eng+2ch-eng+2ch-ger+11subs+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5c66e91ee14378a9750f7ed72b6cb3cf33bed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,92,102,233,30,225,67,120,169,117,15,126,215,43,108,179,207,51,190,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
