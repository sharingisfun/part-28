I believe this is version 2.0 and the production version is 2.1? (My wifi daughter board is v2.1)  \n\nI found this on a Chinese site by searching for the model number on my wifi duaghter board.  It wasn't easy to get it downloaded as everything was in chinese.  Thanks to Google Translate, here it is! \n\nI hope that someone out there has the  knowledge to interpret this and maybe discover how to add the 2nd pci and sim card. \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343950f7ae0306c116313f2bd4a6b92c91565f31","amp;dn":"ACER_W500.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343950f7ae0306c116313f2bd4a6b92c91565f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,57,80,247,174,3,6,193,22,49,63,43,212,166,185,44,145,86,95,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
