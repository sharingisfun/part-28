While it originated in the United States, it is now world-wide. It is self-described as &quot;a Christ-centered organization dedicated to introducing men to Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, helping them to grow as Christians&quot;. Promise Keepers is a non-profit organization, not affiliated with any Christian church or denomination.
