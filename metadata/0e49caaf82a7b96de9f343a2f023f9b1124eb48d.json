Install the 1.13 patch first, then place the directory from this torrent into your bin_win32 directory.\n\nIt should end up here :\n\nJABIA  bin_win32  interface\n\n*IMPORTANT* : When you hit &quot;Start New Game&quot; you will notice that the text for Tactical Mode (it is the second set of checkboxes), as well as the &quot;Start&quot; button, have been replaced with &quot;Invalid Text&quot;. Tactical mode itself works, you just have to tick the second box on the bottom row.\n\nThis is due to a partially corrupted copy of the patch and will no doubt be fixed when SKIDROW release an official proper.\n\n(The last torrent I uploaded included the wrong files. Sorry about that.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e49caaf82a7b96de9f343a2f023f9b1124eb48d","amp;dn":"Jagged+Alliance+Back+in+Action+-+1.13+Patch+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e49caaf82a7b96de9f343a2f023f9b1124eb48d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,73,202,175,130,167,185,109,233,243,67,162,240,35,249,177,18,78,180,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
