North of the Thames is a law abiding, though faintly authoritarian community, where crime is low and life orderly. On the south side of the Thames, life is run by gangs and law &amp; order has long broken down. All the bridges across the Thames have been destroyed, save for the heavily guarded London Bridge.\n\nSergeant Preston lives and works in North London. One day, his 6 year old son disappears. 15 years later, a young man's body drifts from the south bank of the Thames to the north. The now Superintendent Preston, still haunted by his son's disappearance investigates and uncovers a web of intrigue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fa0dd32e897417a9bd5ede26d711cc8bf51387c","amp;dn":"London+Bridge+-+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fa0dd32e897417a9bd5ede26d711cc8bf51387c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,160,221,50,232,151,65,122,155,213,237,226,109,113,28,200,191,81,56,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
