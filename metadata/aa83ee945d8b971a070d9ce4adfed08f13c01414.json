A. (2003)\n\nFor what was probably his only session for an American label, the great pianist Tete Montoliu is heard in top form on a couple of basic originals (&quot;Blues Before Lunch&quot; and &quot;Blues After Lunch&quot;), &quot;Airegin,&quot; &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot; and a lengthy &quot;I Want to Talk About You.&quot; On &quot;Put Your Little Foot Right Out,&quot; he matches wits quite effectively with Chick Corea for a piano duet. Excellent playing, but the music on this LP has not yet been reissued on CD by Fantasy. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Airegin\n02 - Blues Before Lunch\n03 - I Want To Talk About You\n04 - Put Your Little Foot Right Out\n05 - Blues After Lunch\n06 - Sophisticated Lady\n07 - Margareta\n\nEnjoy and share!
