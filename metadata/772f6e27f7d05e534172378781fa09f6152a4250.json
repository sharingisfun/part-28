Over ten million people have since seen the film and it continues to be shown in classrooms, business meetings, festivals and retreats everywhere. Starting with a sleeping man at a picnic, the film takes the viewer on a journey out to the edge of space and then back into a carbon atom in the hand of the man picnic, all in a single shot. It is an unforgettable experience.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:772f6e27f7d05e534172378781fa09f6152a4250","amp;dn":"Powers+of+Ten","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"772f6e27f7d05e534172378781fa09f6152a4250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,47,110,39,247,208,94,83,65,114,55,135,129,250,9,246,21,42,66,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
