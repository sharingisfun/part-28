But it's really expensive, and I think people would benefit from exposure to it. And consider also that you yourself make an excellent case against intellectual property in The Market :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205da4d7b771258317e8b4eda78a203a3a1af8ac","amp;dn":"John+O%5C%27Neill+books+%28The+Market%3B+Markets%2C+Deliberation+and+Envir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205da4d7b771258317e8b4eda78a203a3a1af8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,93,164,215,183,113,37,131,23,232,180,237,167,138,32,58,58,26,248,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
