The only difference being that Dead End is a villain through and through with no intentions of serving anyone.  What makes Dead End so great is his self-aware humor and biting sarcasm--the mark of a true evil genius. Hard to hate and even harder to kill, Dead End is an eloquent psychopath who fights for something better than justice: himself.\n\n\n(I couldn't find this one on TPB so I figured I would upload it myself, no disrespect to any of the fine comics uploaders that keep me reading daily, enjoy!)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed54d4fae49316c07d747a99de362169ba7420e6","amp;dn":"Bad+Ass+%2801+of+04%29+%28Dynamite+Entertainment%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed54d4fae49316c07d747a99de362169ba7420e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,84,212,250,228,147,22,192,125,116,122,153,222,54,33,105,186,116,32,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
