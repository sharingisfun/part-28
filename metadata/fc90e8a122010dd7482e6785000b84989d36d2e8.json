This is a Jesus that I could follow. A Jesus that joked with his friends and yet they knew He was more than just a man. A Jesus who could fall into temptation and yet knew he had a higher calling. I&amp;#039;m sure that some will be upset with Sisto&amp;#039;s Jesus as being TOO modern, but he portrayed Him as a Christ for all the ages. I wish that more biblical movies would have their characters as human beings and not cardboard cut-outs. \n\nWas the above comment useful to you?   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc90e8a122010dd7482e6785000b84989d36d2e8","amp;dn":"Jesus+-+%282000%29+174+min+DVD-Rip+xvid+Please+seed+2%2B+copies+Thanks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc90e8a122010dd7482e6785000b84989d36d2e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,144,232,161,34,1,13,215,72,46,103,133,0,11,132,152,157,54,210,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
