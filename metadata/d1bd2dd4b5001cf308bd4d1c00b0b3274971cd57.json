How do I fix that?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give you a lecture on flash ratios, or start a discussion on flash synchronization and rear curtain sync. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d just say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLower your shutter speed to 1/60 of a second. That should do itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Well, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned just like I would with a friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nEach page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re tired of taking shots that look ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œokay,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t my shots look like that?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ then this is the book for you.\n\nThis isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a book of theoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With nearly another 200 of the most closely guarded photographic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtricks of the trade,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1bd2dd4b5001cf308bd4d1c00b0b3274971cd57","amp;dn":"Scott+Kelby+-+Digital+Photography+Book+Vol+2+2008+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1bd2dd4b5001cf308bd4d1c00b0b3274971cd57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,189,45,212,181,0,28,243,8,189,77,28,0,176,179,39,73,113,205,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
