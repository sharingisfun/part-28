This taxes the available technologies and creates a gap between the huge amount of visual data required for multimedia applications and the still-limited hardware capabilities. Image and Video Compression for Multimedia Engineering bridges the gap with concise, authoritative information on video and image coding.The tutorial provides a solid, comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals and algorithms of coding and details all of the relevant international coding standards. It presents recent findings on defining methods for generating high quality video bitstreams. The authors present recent research results and cover emerging technologies.With the growing popularity of the applications that use large amounts of visual data, image and video coding is an active and dynamic field. Coverage of both image and video compression in this book yields a unique, self-contained reference, appropriate for all related professions. Image and Video Compression for Multimedia Engineering builds a basis for future study, research, and development.\n\nISBN:  0849334918\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f06ddcde7eb1238162d7c1cef120317aee5ccad","amp;dn":"Image+%2B+Video+Compression+for+Multimedia+Engineering-2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f06ddcde7eb1238162d7c1cef120317aee5ccad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,6,221,205,231,235,18,56,22,45,124,28,239,18,3,23,174,229,204,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
