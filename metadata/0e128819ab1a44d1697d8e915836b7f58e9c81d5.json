Edward Griffin, Jim Marrs, Bill Hicks, Daniel Estulin, Jim Tucker, Ted Gunderson, Anthony Hilder, Professor Steven Jones, Webster Tarpley, George Carlin, John Taylor Gatto, Charlotte Iserbyt, Dave vonKleist, Stan Monteith and othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nWilliam Cooper - Police State:\n\nSurrounding us in our day-to-day lives are mysteries, that to spend our days pondering would paralyze us from leading productive lives. So we turn away from these thoughts in order to seek out as trouble free an existence as we can. Then there are those who have made it their business to explore and expose these mysteries; to remind us of what we already know on some deep subconscious level, that things are rarely what they seem on the surface. Bill Copper was such a man.\n\nCooperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commitment to exposing the truth as he saw it, with the information he had at the time, is nothing short of inspiring. Very few of us would go to the length Cooper did in order to inform and educate what he knew would always be only a small portion of our population.\n\nThe type of material Cooper spent his life exposing is the kind of thing we would prefer to consider exists only in fictional literary works and science fiction movies. For to even ponder that such ideas can exist in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is nothing short of disturbing. Yet Cooper, through meticulous research, fact checking, and of course his own experiences in Naval Intelligence, reminded us these things do indeed have a place in reality. He warned us that the science fiction we so eagerly digest is more truthful than we would ever care to consider.\n\nBill was reared in an air force family and spent his childhood and young adult life traveling the world on military assignments. Bill served honorably in Vietnam, spent time running a small university, opened an art gallery, married, had children, and eventually penned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBehold A Pale HorseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nThis book synthesized the disturbing documents he witnessed while in the military, and expressed his utter shock in seeing these plans carried out years later against an unknowing populace.\n\nBill would spend the remainder of his life broadcasting on shortwave and satellite radio, as well as giving standing room only lectures to inform people of what he knew. Bill was compelled to impress upon them that unless we do something, a very dark future would lie ahead.\n\n\nInvisible Empire  A New World Order Defined:\n\nJason Bermas presents Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined produced by Alex Jones. The film can be ordered here http://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/inemnewwoord.html\n\nIn the tradition of his first Internet blockbuster, Loose Change, which has had over 100 million visits, Jason Bermas has created yet another outstanding documentary film, Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined.\n\nThis film documents very clearly that some of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most powerful elected officials, including all recent presidents, have been part of an international cabal to establish a socialist New World Order that would eradicate national sovereignty and many of the God-given freedoms vouchsafed in the Constitution of the United States, making all citizens mere slaves of the state.\n\nIt has an amazing collection of video footage of these leaders stating their unabashed ambitions to establishing this New World Order. It also shows just who is behind this international cabal and their nefarious intentions and true sinister nature. It is deeply troubling and very important.\n\nAgain, its relevance to Free Energy technology is two-fold. First, these same forces are behind many of the instances of suppression of breakthrough free energy, which would empower the individual, contrary to the NWO agenda to enslave. Second, the emergence of breakthrough free energy technologies will help unseat these criminals. It is a powerful antidote to the poison being administered.\n\nAnother point of relevance is that the film touches on the fact that Al Gore is one of the New World Order insiders helping to accomplish their objectives by politicizing climate change and using it as a reason to impose global carbon taxes; all while personally becoming super wealthy from his various involvements that include serious conflicts of interest. He should not be seen as a hero figure in the free energy movement.\n\n\nIron Mountain Blueprint to Tyranny - Full RARE Video:\n\nThe Video that started it all - written about in the WALL STREET JOURNAL and the subject of an NBC DATELINE.  They claim this is a hoax...but I don't think hoaxes work this well. History has been unfolding almost right inline with the report.  This is a 2:40 hour documentary investigating the little known IRON MOUNTAIN REPORT, leaked to the press in 1967. Purports to be a top-secret government plan to bring in the New World Order and the ultimate plans for American citizens. Declared a hoax, it was later verified by a top Pentagon official as real. The agenda is being carried out right under the noses of the American people. UFOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play a major role in the Iron Mountain NWO. It is all about people control via deception and manipulation. Deep into Eugenics, birth control and hideous plans for a tyrannical slave state. It is all coming true after OKC and 9-11 with the Patriot Act, Homeland Security and the military police operating in America. Airports first, railroads, then highways, and finally a complete LOCKDOWN under the pretense of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsecurityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. A MUST SEE VIDEO\n\n\nReflections And Warnings - An Interview With Aaron Russo:\n\nAlex JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ latest DVD documentary release, Reflections And Warnings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ An Interview With Aaron Russo, pays homage to maverick patriot Aaron Russo, who left this mortal coil in August 2007 after a long battle with cancer. The film is a 90 minute full version of JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ seminal interview with Russo, which took place months before his death.\n\nThis was RussoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final videotaped interview before he passed away, but his legacy as the founder of the movement to end the power monopoly of the Federal Reserve makes the documentary more contemporary than ever before in light of how the Federal Reserve has increased its stranglehold over the American economy since the beginning of the financial crisis last year.\n\nThe conversation on the DVD features many shocking revelations that were divulged by RussoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one-time close friend Nick Rockefeller about the eliteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s agenda for mankind.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
