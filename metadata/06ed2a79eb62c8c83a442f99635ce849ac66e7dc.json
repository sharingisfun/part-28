Radio transmissions from strange sources indicate that people are going into hiding. All Sam and Claire need to do is look around the neighborhood: In the park, parents wither beneath the powerful screams of their children. At night, suburban side streets become routes of shameful escape for fathers trying to get outside the radius of affliction. \n \nWith Claire nearing collapse, it seems their only means of survival is to flee from their daughter, Esther, who laughs at her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sickness, unaware that in just a few years she, too, will be susceptible to the language toxicity. But Sam and Claire find it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so easy to leave the daughter they still love, even as they waste away from her malevolent speech. On the eve of their departure, Claire mysteriously disappears, and Sam, determined to find a cure for this new toxic language, presses on alone into a world beyond recognition. \n \nThe Flame Alphabet invites the question: What is left of civilization when we lose the ability to communicate with those we love? Both morally engaged and wickedly entertaining, a gripping page-turner as strange as it is moving, this intellectual horror story ensures Ben MarcusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position in the first rank of American novelists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ed2a79eb62c8c83a442f99635ce849ac66e7dc","amp;dn":"The+Flame+Alphabet.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ed2a79eb62c8c83a442f99635ce849ac66e7dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,237,42,121,235,98,200,200,58,68,47,153,99,92,232,73,172,102,231,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
