I think it took a toll on a lot of people. This thing was not just Mike McDonald, this was Uptown Saint John who really put a lot of sweat equity into this,&quot; he said.\n\nUptown Saint John could no longer lead the project, which had an estimated upfront cost of $3.5 million, without financial commitments from government and the private sector.\n\nThe building is still standing, but McDonald says there doesn't seem to be enough community interest to transform it into an entertainment centre.\n\n&quot;It wasn't just a disappointment for me, I think there was a lot of disappointment because I know a lot of Uptown Saint John saw this vision as an important cog in the wheel for the municipality as a whole.&quot;\n\nThe documentary, by Hemmings House Pictures, will be shown on CBC-TV Saturday at 8 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5152b9f1d501e72d719f8c24b269d5853e949e45","amp;dn":"Absolutely.Canadian-Saving.The.Paramount.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5152b9f1d501e72d719f8c24b269d5853e949e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,82,185,241,213,1,231,45,113,159,140,36,178,105,213,133,62,148,158,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
