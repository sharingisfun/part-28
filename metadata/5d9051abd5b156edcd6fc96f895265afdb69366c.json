NOT SUPPORTED ON GMA CHIPSETS AND POWERPC MACS!!!! Movies work and mouse works in menus\n\nGame Description:\nFive years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption. Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers.\nNow, it\\\\\\'s the early 90s. Carl\\\\\\'s got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster.\nOn his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.\n \n\nPort Info\n\nCider 4003\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\nMac OSX 10.5 Leopard , Snow Leopard 6.0\n1GHz Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon Processor\n256MB of RAM\n8x DVD-ROM Drive\n3.6 GB of free Hard Disk space for a minimal install\n64MB Video Card with DirectX 9 compatible drivers (\\\\\\&quot;GeForce3\\\\\\&quot; or better)\nDirectX 9 compatible Stereo Sound Card\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\n\nKnown Issues:\nIsn\\\\\\'t any so far for me. The mouse and the movies work so no more having to tap spacebar. There is a slight issue on some macs though. If you have this problem then that means you will have to stick with the old wrapper because this one wont work for you.\nInstallation:\n\nInstall GTA San Andreas with the CX installer/Crossover/Parallels/ or Windows and drag and drop the contents of the GTA San Andreas folder to your desktop. Right click GTA San Andreas and click Show package contents . Then navigate to Contents&gt;Resources&gt;transgaming&gt;c_drive&gt;Program Files&gt;Rockstar Games and then place your GTA San Andreas folder there.\n\nNOTE: You HAVE to install the legacy CXZ Engines.dmg and recommended CXZ Engines.dmg before you play because cider 4003 needs the Black Diamond Engine to be installed\n\n\nPlease give thanks to me for this port. follow my torrents on the pirate bay     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/MacLovered&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/MacLovered&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d9051abd5b156edcd6fc96f895265afdb69366c","amp;dn":"GTA+SA+Wrapper+By+Maclovered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d9051abd5b156edcd6fc96f895265afdb69366c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,144,81,171,213,177,86,237,205,111,201,111,137,82,101,175,219,105,54,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
