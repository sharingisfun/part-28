It's the perfect chick fronted swede rock soundtrack to your \n   next lemon party.\n\n   The Sounds return with their third album, Crossing The Rubicon . A\n   career-defining eleven song set that demonstrates the type of growth that can\n   only come from a band in total command of their talents. Their synth-pop,\n   guitar driven sound still takes center stage, but there s an ambition and\n   sophistication to both the songs and production that reveals new layers of\n   depth to the overall aesthetic. Recorded in Sweden, Los Angeles and New York,\n   Crossing The Rubicon continues to deliver the big, fist pumping, arena sized\n   anthems the band are known for. These songs have an undeniable energy. From\n   the electro, club banger, Beatbox, to the cocksure beauty of the album s\n   first single No One Sleeps When I m Awake , the new album presents a more\n   fully formed version of the sound that established them as both a fan and\n   critics favorite.\n\n   Over the last few years, The Sounds have garnered a massive fanbase built\n   upon non-stop touring, two acclaimed records, great film/TV and video game\n   placements and an organic word of mouth reaction. Renowned for their intense\n   and exuberant live shows, The have captivated fans around the world, playing\n   more than 500 shows in support of 2006 s Dying To Say This To You , selling\n   out major venues in over 25 countries worldwide, including the legendary\n   Hollywood Palladium (to the delight of 4000 fans), and selling half a million\n   records world wide.\n\n   Crossing The Rubicon promises to be the band s best selling record to date as\n   the band has been confirmed to support No Doubt all summer long.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
