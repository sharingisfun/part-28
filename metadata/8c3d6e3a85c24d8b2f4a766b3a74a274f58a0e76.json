APHRODITE V DEBUTS! For the first time in history, mankind is outpacing evolution. It takes nature thousands of years to adapt to changes and the things humanity has accomplished technologically in just the past 100 years has thrown its ability to evolve, and in turn survive, completely out of whack. In other words, a world full of wonders and conveniences is being created that none will hope to survive. This dilemma is at the heart of what CYBER FORCE is all about. The massive corporation CDI continues to engineer technologically enhanced humans. Cyber Force, terrorists or resistance fighters depending on your point of view try and regroup and reveal the conspiracy that is behind the heart of CDI and its mission. Aphrodite V and Stryker make their debut!\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for this release.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7755413/Cyberforce_01_(1440_&amp;_2048px-HD)(Tarutaru-DCP)_[DCP-D]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7755413/Cyberforce_01_(1440_&amp;_2048px-HD)(Tarutaru-DCP)_[DCP-D]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3d6e3a85c24d8b2f4a766b3a74a274f58a0e76","amp;dn":"Cyberforce+v4+02+%282012%29%281440px%26amp%3B2048px-HD%29%28TaruTariat-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3d6e3a85c24d8b2f4a766b3a74a274f58a0e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,61,110,58,133,194,77,139,47,74,118,107,58,116,162,116,245,138,14,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
