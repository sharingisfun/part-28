Often harried but rarely ruffled, the character was first created for the opening titles of the live-action film The Pink Panther (1964), which starred Peter Sellers as a bumbling French policeman pursuing an exotic diamond called the Pink Panther. The animated titles were so popular that DePatie and Freleng immediately set to work on a series of animated shorts, in the vein of Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse. The Panther cartoons had no dialogue, but were backed by variations on Henry Mancini&amp;#039;s slithery, saxophone-y Pink Panther theme (also from the original film). In the 1970s the Pink Panther acquired his own Saturday-morning TV show and all the other trappings of cartoon stardom. Several sequels to the original live-action film also were made, and the two Pink Panthers ran in parallel universes for more than 15 years.\n\nThe Pink Panther appeared in a long-running series of ads for Owens Corning insulation... The first Pink Panther short, Pink Phink, was released late in 1964 and won an Oscar as the year&amp;#039;s best animated short.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a693fbd23d9ca2774055d701da4dba640e49e4bb","amp;dn":"The+Pink+Panther+S01ep.46-90%5BCartoon%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a693fbd23d9ca2774055d701da4dba640e49e4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,147,251,210,61,156,162,119,64,85,215,1,218,77,186,100,14,73,228,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
