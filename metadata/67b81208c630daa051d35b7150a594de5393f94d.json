This special presentation will show you how to: validate your inner child through meditations and affirmations; give your child permission to break destructive family roles and rules; adopt new rules allowing pleasure and honest self-exploration; deal with anger and difficult relationships; pay attention to your innermost purpose and desires...and find new joy and energy in living.
