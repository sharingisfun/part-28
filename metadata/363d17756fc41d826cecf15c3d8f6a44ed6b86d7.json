This record is akin to a journey through the darkest regions of space, as beautifully abstract layers of sound, intricate synthesizers, and heart-wrenching female vocals meld together in perfect harmony.  Sleep Ã¢Ë†Å¾ Over is very much left of center but fans of experimental electro pop will certainly find much to enjoy.  Whether it be the the transcendent synthpop of &quot;Romantic Streams&quot; or the lo-fi bedroom sex pop of &quot;Stickers,&quot; the entire album is like the soundtrack to your dreams.  The otherworldly grandeur known as &quot;Outer Limits&quot; is included as a bonus track.\n\n01. Behind Closed Doors\n02. Romantic Streams\n03. Porcelain Hands\n04. The Heavens Turn By Themselves\n05. Casual Diamond\n06. Cryingame\n07. Flying Saucers Are Real\n08. Stickers\n09. Untitled\n10. Don't Poison Everything\n11. Outer Limits (Bonus Track)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:363d17756fc41d826cecf15c3d8f6a44ed6b86d7","amp;dn":"Sleep+%26infin%3B+Over+-+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"363d17756fc41d826cecf15c3d8f6a44ed6b86d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,61,23,117,111,196,29,130,108,236,241,92,61,143,106,68,237,107,134,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
