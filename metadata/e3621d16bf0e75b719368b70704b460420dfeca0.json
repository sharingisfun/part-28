However, your device wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be usable until it resprings after reorganizing iOS 7.1.xÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filesystem (refer to the video).\n\n\nnot my app all credits go to the chinese hackers pangu team!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jailbreakpangu.com/jailbreak-7.1.1-untethered-ios-7.1-pangu-iphone-5s-ipad-all-idevices/#more-3087&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jailbreakpangu.com/jailbreak-7.1.1-untethered-ios-7.1-pangu-iphone-5s-ipad-all-idevices/#more-3087&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3621d16bf0e75b719368b70704b460420dfeca0","amp;dn":"jailbreak+iOs7.1+allrights+reserved+to+Pangu+chinese+dev+team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3621d16bf0e75b719368b70704b460420dfeca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,98,29,22,191,14,117,183,25,54,139,112,112,75,70,4,32,223,236,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
