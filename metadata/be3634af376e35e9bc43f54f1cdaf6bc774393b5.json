Everyone who purchases an album will be able to name one of the organizations in our Directory as a beneficiary. That organization receives 30% of the sale price.\n\nFor the Hindu Student Council in Iowa, or the classical dance team in Georgia, this means quick cash for very little effort and no upfront cost. But for our community, this means that in just a few weeks, hundreds, maybe thousands of us will be thinking about the same thing at the same time. In the long run, we're much more interested in the latter.\n\n\nSpread The Word\n\nIf you're reading this, we hope you're as excited as we are. Invite your friends to the concert. Share this note. We'll see you on December 2nd.\n\nGet The Album\n\nThe album is officially on sale!
