The band, consisting of singer Ami Shalev, guitarist Yonatan Gat, and drummer Ran Shimoni, channel riff heavy influences Led Zeppelin, the Sonics, and Thin Lizzy to create raw, driving rock &amp; roll. Shortly after forming, they would accomplish their mission in Tel Aviv, defying the expectations of what a rock show should be there. They would set up on the floor among the crowd and proceed to turn every performance into a wild party, wild enough that more often then not they would find the power getting shut off on them or the police called to break up the show. Eventually finding themselves banned from most of the venues in Tel Aviv, the band decided to leave Israel so they could tour the United States and Europe. From 2006 to 2007, Monotonix played over 300 shows around the world, including SXSW and a tour with Silver Jews. These tours furthered their reputation as a band whose shows are not watched, but experienced. Monotonix have become known for setting themselves and their equipment on fire, stealing drinks from audience members to pour on themselves, and generally turning their shows into unabashed, frenzied dance parties. In 2007, the band recorded their first EP, Body Language, with Tim Green of the Fucking Champs. The album arrived in April of 2008 on Drag City. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Nasty Fancy\n02.Everything That I See\n03.Before I Pass Away\n04.Blind Again\n05.Fun Fun Fun\n06.Give Me More\n07.You And Me\n08.Try Try Try\n09.Late Night\n10.Never Died Before\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b07c11285dbf124bbe6c1cc090d2bb58ca87ddf","amp;dn":"Monotonix+-+Not+Yet++%282011%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b07c11285dbf124bbe6c1cc090d2bb58ca87ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,7,193,18,133,219,241,36,187,230,193,204,9,13,43,181,140,168,125,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
