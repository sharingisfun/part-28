VMware&amp;#039;s first product for\nthe new Intel Macs makes it easier than ever to take advantage of the\nsecurity, flexibility, and portability of virtual machines. VMware\nFusion provides an intuitive user interface for creating virtual \nmachines, and for running preconfigured virtual machines created \nwith VMware Workstation, VMware Server, and ESX Server. With VMware \nFusion, you can run your favorite Windows applications on your Mac. \nYou can also download virtual machines from the VMware Technology Network\n(VMTN) Web site, which has a growing library of virtual appliances with\na wide range of pre-installed and preconfigured applications and operating\nsystems.\n\nFeatures of VMware Fusion:\n\n    * You can use 32-bit and 64-bit guest operating systems in VMware\n    Fusion virtual machines. VMware Fusion supports Windows, Linux, \n    and Solaris operating systems in virtual machines.\n    * Your virtual machines can have multiple virtual processors, \n    taking advantage of the Intel Core Duo chips in today&amp;#039;s newest \n    Intel Macs.\n    * VMware Fusion supports high-speed USB 2.0 for a huge range of\n    devices. Even devices that do not have drivers for Mac OS X will\n    work in a virtual machine.\n    * Virtual machines seamlessly integrate with your Mac: you can \n    cut and paste text between your Mac and your virtual machines, \n    drag and drop files, and create shared folders on your computer \n    so you can easily share files and folders.\n    * Unity view displays your Windows virtual machine applications \n    directly on your Mac desktop. The virtual machine window is hidden, \n    and your virtual machine applications are displayed in the Mac dock,\n    so you can use them just as you use your native Mac applications. \n    See Using Unity View.\n    * You can burn CDs or DVDs to your Mac&amp;#039;s rewritable optical drive \n    from within your virtual machine.\n\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.2\n\nVMware Fusion 1.1.2 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a \nvariety of issues.\n\nVMware Fusion 1.1.2:\n\n    * Corrects a problem in which the remapping of keyboard shortcuts \n    in Full Screen or Single Window view could not be disabled. Deselecting\n    Enable Mac OS keyboard shortcuts now works as expected.\n    * Fixes a problem that could arise when the user attempted to run a \n    virtual machine with the virtual CD drive connected but without a \n    drive connected to the Mac. This problem was most likely to happen \n    on a MacBook Air. The virtual machine no longer fails in this situation.\n    * Adds support for Windows XP SP3 when importing a Boot Camp partition \n    as a virtual machine.\n    * Fixes a problem that prevented the user from being able to burn \n    CDs with a USB Superdrive on the MacBook Air.\n    * Fixes a problem that caused VMware Fusion to fail when the user \n    pressed some newly introduced keys on the new slim Apple keyboard, \n    if the Enable debugging checks preference was set.\n    * Corrects a problem in which VMware Fusion occasionally would not\n    return a USB device to Mac OS control when a virtual machine was shut\n    down. VMware Fusion now makes sure to disconnect the device from the \n    virtual machine, making it available to the Mac.\n    * Fixes a compatibility problem with wireless bridging and DHCP/routing \n    behavior that could prevent a virtual machine from getting an IP \n    address in certain cases.\n    * Corrects a sound problem in which only the default speaker worked \n    in certain cases.\n    * In some cases, VMware Fusion, after being upgraded to Version 1.1.1, \n    would fail with a Signal 10 error when the user tried to use the keyboard. \n    This problem has been fixed.\n    * Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) no longer causes memory \n    corruption. Version 1.1.2 contains a fix for the problem described in \n    security advisory VMSA-2008-0005.html, section i.\n\nVMware Fusion 1.1.2 and Mac OS X Leopard Time Machine Issue Resolved\n\n    * A bug in the Mac OS X 10.5-10.5.1 operating systems caused the system \n    to fail if Time Machine attempted to back up live virtual machines. \n    To avoid this, VMware Fusion 1.1 excluded all virtual machines from Time \n    Machine backups. Apple resolved the Time Machine bug in Mac OS X 10.5.2,\n    so VMware Fusion 1.1.2 now allows Time Machine backups of virtual machines\n    if the Mac is running Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher. This may result in larger\n    Time Machine backups. If the backups are now too large, you can manually\n    exclude your virtual machines from Time Machine backup and copy them \n    separately to your backup disk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4ce1cc219cb8125f4d7b28b0a5ffa5febeabc5e","amp;dn":"VMware+Fusion+1.1.2+Build+87978+-ZIONOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4ce1cc219cb8125f4d7b28b0a5ffa5febeabc5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,206,28,194,25,203,129,37,244,215,178,139,10,95,250,95,235,234,188,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
