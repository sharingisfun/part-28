Adaptive and knowledge-based user interfaces, universal accessibility, human-robot interaction,\nagent-driven human computer interaction, and sharable mobile devices are a few of these trends. ACHI\n2009 brings also a suite of specific domain applications, such as gaming, social, medicine, education and engineering.\n\nThe event was very competitive in its selection process and very well perceived by the international\nscientific and industrial communities. As such, it is attracting excellent contributions and active\nparticipation from all over the world. We were very pleased to receive a large amount of top quality\ncontributions.\n\nThe accepted papers covered a wide range of human-computer interaction related topics such as\ngraphical user interfaces, input methods, training, recognition, and applications.\n\nWe believe that the ACHI 2009 contributions offered a large panel of solutions to key problems in all\nareas of human-computer interaction.\n\nWe take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the ACHI 2009 technical program\ncommittee as well as the numerous reviewers. The creation of such a broad and high quality conference\nprogram would not have been possible without their involvement. We also kindly thank all the authors that\ndedicated much of their time and efforts to contribute to the ACHI 2009. We truly believe that thanks to all\nthese efforts, the final conference program consists of top quality contributions.\n\nThis event could also not have been a reality without the support of many individuals, organizations and\nsponsors. In addition, we also gratefully thank the members of the ACHI 2009 organizing committee for\ntheir help in handling the logistics and for their work that is making this professional meeting a success.\n\nWe hope the ACHI 2009 was a successful international forum for the exchange of ideas and results\nbetween academia and industry and to promote further progress in the human-computer interaction field.\nCancunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exotic and historical places surely provided a pleasant environment during the conference\nand we hope you had a chance to visit the surroundings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08df5b3b3bbd38e36eb62017bbc7472384bac824","amp;dn":"The+Second+InternationalConferences+on+Advances+in+Computer-Huma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08df5b3b3bbd38e36eb62017bbc7472384bac824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,223,91,59,59,189,56,227,110,182,32,23,187,199,71,35,132,186,200,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
