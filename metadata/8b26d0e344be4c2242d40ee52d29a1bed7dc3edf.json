Something for both the mind and the body, yep this album has it all. Slabs of groove so solid you could lay a patio with 'em, plus tunes and stuff.\n\nThe music on this particular demo disc comprises the first material I composed using a PC alone, as opposed to the racks of horrendously expensive electronic equipment I previously used to work with.\nHopefully the results stand up for themselves so there's little need for me to rattle on any more about it.\n\nEnjoy responsibly, under adult supervision.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b26d0e344be4c2242d40ee52d29a1bed7dc3edf","amp;dn":"Midnite+Classix+-+Feeding+The+Thin+Air","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b26d0e344be4c2242d40ee52d29a1bed7dc3edf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,38,208,227,68,190,76,34,66,212,14,229,45,41,161,190,215,220,62,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
