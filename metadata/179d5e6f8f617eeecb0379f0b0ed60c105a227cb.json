It explores the main venues of constitutional practice in ancient Athens, Republican Rome, Renaissance Venice, the Dutch Republic, seventeenth-century England, and eighteenth-century America.\nFrom its beginning in Polybius' interpretation of the classical concept of &quot;mixed government,&quot; the author traces the theory of constitutionalism through its late medieval appearance in the Conciliar Movement of church reform and in the Huguenot defense of minority rights. After noting its suppression with the emergence of the nation-state and the Bodinian doctrine of &quot;sovereignty,&quot; the author describes how constitutionalism was revived in the English conflict between king and Parliament in the early Stuart era, and how it has developed since then into the modern concept of constitutional democracy.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nWhile not defending any particular version of constiturionalism as best, Gordon argues persuasively that some form of constitutional government is necessary for both prosperity and the preservation of individual liberty. (R. Hudelson Choice)\n\nAn unusually sweeping book...[Gordon] provides a...concise and accessible introduction to the history of constitutional government ... Particularly valuable for its distinctive emphasis on countervailing power as the cornerstone of constitutional governance and its broad survey of the practice and idea of constitutionalism over the course of Western history. (Keith E. Whittington Law and Politics Book Review)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nScott Gordon is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Economics and of the History and Philosophy of Science at Indiana University, Bloomington, and Professsor Emeritus of Economics at Queen's University, Canada.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:179d5e6f8f617eeecb0379f0b0ed60c105a227cb","amp;dn":"Scott+Gordon+-+Controlling+the+State.+Constitutionalism+from+Anc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"179d5e6f8f617eeecb0379f0b0ed60c105a227cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,157,94,111,143,97,126,238,203,3,121,240,176,237,96,193,5,162,39,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
