KIAD scenery depicts the Washington-Dulles International Airport as it exists today.  We did, however, take the liberty to clean up some of the construction debris associated with the ongoing Dulles redevelopment project known as D2.  Some of those improvements include the new north-south runway, the concourse B expansion, and the AeroTrain stations located at the main terminal and at concourse B*. All other major buildings within the airport boundaries, including the current, expanded Terminal building, the new Z gates, the brand new tower, and the midfield concourses A, B, C and D have been portrayed accurately.  Special attention has been paid to the precise location of gates and parking spots.  The field layout has been modified to accurately represent the real airport including runways, taxiways, aprons and signage. \n\nAs a bonus, the Steven Udvar-Hazy Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum has been modeled in detail.  This magnificent structure is clearly visible during approach to runway 01R. \n \nScenery Features:\n\nCustom-made, optimized Gmax models of the main terminal building, four concourses, new control tower, GA, and other service buildings within the airport grounds \nCustom-made, optimized textures for all Gmax generated buildings, including reflective textures in the FSX version \nCustom-made, photo real ground textures in and around the airport \nAccurate runway and taxiway layout, including detailed markings, signals, and navigational aids \nCustom-made AI mapping file (AFCAD) \nThe scenery is offered in two versions, one for FS2004 and another for FSX\n\n------------\n\nWith many thanks to Mutant","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad024b50b7dc29934c2eae8d124c865ca94b7446","amp;dn":"FSX+-+BluePrint+Simulations+-+KIAD+v1.1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad024b50b7dc29934c2eae8d124c865ca94b7446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,2,75,80,183,220,41,147,76,46,174,141,18,76,134,92,169,75,116,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
