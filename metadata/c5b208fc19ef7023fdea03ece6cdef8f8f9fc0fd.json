Skinny Fists\n\nWhile guitarist Yair Yona was first lured into the world of acoustic fingerpicking by a Bert Jansch CD that he found in a London shop, the Takoma school is his foundation. Like Steffen Basho-Junghans, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s embraced this fundamentally American style on its own terms, learned its language inside out, and still made music thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true to an upbringing on the far side of the Greenwich Meridian.\n\nThe gamboling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStruggled So HardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is so steeped in country blues that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d best lock your car doors if you play it whilst driving through a crossroads; the devilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to want to collect on those stolen licks. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSympathy For The JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a fairly blatant rewrite of Jack RoseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKensington Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but it transcends retread status by staying truer to the parent tuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jubilant spirit than its melody. It also bears mentioning that the piece was written and recorded while Rose was alive; this album first came out in miniscule numbers on the Anova label last year.\n\nAs the preposterously lengthy title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFloodgate Opens to Allow a Ship to Come Through (As It Carries The Passenger Fahey On It)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ suggests and the dancing, propulsive picking throughout confirms, he self-consciously frames his music within the American Primitive tradition. And yet, that tune also shows how the individuality of YonatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s synthesis by using synths and electric guitars to thicken the textures in ways that Fahey never indulged.\n\nComing up on age 30 and born and raised in Israel, his reference points include American indie rock and Eastern European folk, and both get play here. The plugged-in, unabashedly epic elements of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFloodgateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lift whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good from the framework of Godspeed You! Black EmperorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epic and leave out the soapbox haranguing. And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRussian Dance,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with its not-quite-dry-eyed accordion and lilting mandolin, could probably get him repeat bookings at a Slavic exileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.\n\nThis is a solid debut, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to hear Yona get further past his influences and, like Basho-Junghans, into a sound that is completely his own. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2012/02/08/yair-yona/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b208fc19ef7023fdea03ece6cdef8f8f9fc0fd","amp;dn":"Yair+Yona...+Remember%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b208fc19ef7023fdea03ece6cdef8f8f9fc0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,178,8,252,25,239,112,35,253,234,3,236,230,205,239,143,143,159,192,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
