Bush and Barack Obama during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nWhen Robert M. Gates received a call from the White House, he thought he'd long left Washington politics behind: After working for six presidents in both the CIA and the National Security Council, he was happily serving as president of Texas A&amp;M University. But when he was asked to help a nation mired in two wars and to aid the troops doing the fighting, he answered what he felt was the call of duty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c459e6d5bee62ee88b9eaf9d3104c70ac6d5aa7","amp;dn":"Duty+-+Robert+M.+Gates+-+Audiobook+MP3+CBR+64k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c459e6d5bee62ee88b9eaf9d3104c70ac6d5aa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,69,158,109,91,238,98,238,136,185,234,249,211,16,76,112,172,109,90,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
