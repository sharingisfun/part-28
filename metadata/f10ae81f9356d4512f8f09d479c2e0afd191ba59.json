Born and raised in Edinburgh, Chris created an alternate history website and eventually graduated to writing full-sized novels.\n\nStudying history independently allowed him to develop worlds that hung together and provided a base for storytelling. After graduating from university, Chris started writing full-time. As an indie author, he has published ten novels (so far) through Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.\n\nThe Royal Sorceress is his first novel to be professionally published. Chris is currently living in Borneo with his partner, muse, and critic Aisha.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f10ae81f9356d4512f8f09d479c2e0afd191ba59","amp;dn":"Retreat+Hell+by+Christopher+Nuttall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f10ae81f9356d4512f8f09d479c2e0afd191ba59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,10,232,31,147,86,212,81,47,143,9,212,121,194,224,175,209,145,186,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
