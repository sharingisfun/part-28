During the summer of 2011, McLaren launched the MP4-12C. It is claimed that this 168,500 pound super car is one of the most cutting-edge and glamorous machines ever built and shows British design and precision engineering at its best. The programme goes inside the McLaren factory, meets the team of engineers and McLaren boss Ron Dennis, and discovers how the car has been designed, tested and built from scratch, including its unique carbon-fibre \\'monocell\\' technology and its engine - the first the company has ever built. Plus the film finds out what racing drivers Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton think about the car and there is a look at how its sound was created in a studio. To build the car the company also had to build a brand new facility. The film follows events as production starts and discovers if the huge investment - and gamble - looks like paying off. \n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720) \nVCodec: x264 from AVC \nCopy AC3 2ch 192Kbps stream\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720 \n\nFlawless encoding \nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e444d2fb0b4a70cd4b53a667c13912786cd477","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+How+to+Build+a+Super+Car+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e444d2fb0b4a70cd4b53a667c13912786cd477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,228,68,210,251,11,74,112,205,75,83,166,103,193,57,18,120,108,212,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
