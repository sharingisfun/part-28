Groban co-wrote the majority of the\nsongs, including Hidden Away, which he wrote with Dan Wilson - former leader\nof the band Semisonic and co-writer of several cuts on the Dixie Chicks Not\nReady to Make Nice. Hidden Away was recorded live with Groban singing and\nplaying piano, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on acoustic guitars, and veteran\nR&amp;B icon Spooner Oldham on organ, with a striking orchestral arrangement by\nDavid Campbell added later. The opening piano chords and the unfolding melody\nevoke a timeless Americana, a thread from Stephen Foster through Aaron Copland\nthrough Paul Simon and Randy Newman, as Groban makes a heartfelt plea not to\nhide true love or ones true self.\n\nIlluminations finds both Groban and Rubin stepping out of each ones\nrespective zone and creating an entirely new zone. The bracing result fulfills\nRubins vision of a fine art Groban record, marrying the warmth of the\nsweeping American roots of Grobans writing and the grandeur of classical\nsettings by matching the live, one-take performances by Groban and the intimate,\ncore acoustic band with colorful orchestral arrangements by David Campbell and\nJames Newton Howard.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a39413fb3012c8342d38427ceb747179bf8e98a0","amp;dn":"Josh+Groban+Illuminations+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a39413fb3012c8342d38427ceb747179bf8e98a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,148,19,251,48,18,200,52,45,56,66,124,235,116,113,121,191,142,152,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
