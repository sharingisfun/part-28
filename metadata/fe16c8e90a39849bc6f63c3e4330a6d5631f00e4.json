That is why the FonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Budai ZenehÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡z set to work to provide the financial background and facilities necessary to do this comprehensive collection of Transylvanian village music.\nThe Final Hour project is supported by the Institute of Musiscology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Starting in September 1997, there have been regular recording sessions with bands from Transylvanian villages who still play the local traditional music. Each band is at our disposal for five days during which time it is possible to make archival recordings of not only each bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repertoire of melodies which serves the entertainment needs of more than one ethnic group, but also to document information regarding customs surrounding the traditional music and dance life. Singers and one or two couples of good dancers arrive to Budapest for these recording sessions with each band, helping to maintain the vocal and dance function of the instrumental music. Part of the program is devoted to documentation of the existing Transylvanian traditional flute music.\nThe CD archive resulting from work of the Final Hour program offers a vast amount of material on the musical traditions of Hungarians, Romanians, Gypsies, Saxons and Jews in Transylvania for research studies as well as a wealth of authentic material and background information for those involved in popular folk music movements. The complete collection will be available for scientific research in the archive of the Institute of Musicology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\nThe FonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Records has started this series of CDs under the title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tria,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ presenting selections of the most representative material from the collection. This series is the spiritual descendant of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡triaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series from the end of the 1930ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s by BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k, ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n KodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ly and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Lajtha in cooperation with the Hungarian Radio and the Museum of Ethnography.\n\n\nVol4: GyimesbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼kk - HidegsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g (GhimeÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸). Original Village music from the Eastern Carpathians of Transylvania: Gyimes (in Romanian, GhimeÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸) is located on the border of Hargita and BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ counties, northeast of the town of CsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­kszereda (Miercurea Ciuc). It lies beyond the Carpathian watershed, in the easternmost reaches of what, according to Hungarian history, was known as CsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k County. In the high mountainous terrain, agriculture can only play a secondary role, that's why there, living off the land means primarily animal husbandry and forestry. The Gyimes man is famous for his knowledge of wood, he is a fantastic carpenter, and knows everything about animals and shepherding. And amongst shepherds there are always a lot of good flute players. The people of Gyimes love to have a good time, they know a lot of tunes and their whole culture, thus the music as well, is full of elements from Central Asia or the Middle Ages.\nThe music and dance culture of the CsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ people of Gyimes, despite the ethnic variations, is quite uniform. Most of their vocabulary of melodies can be considered rather archaic, unique variations of CsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©kely melodies. The people of the nearby FelcsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k area, often say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a CsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ tuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ about an old melody, which is no longer fashionable there, but which is still popular amongst the traditional faithful Gyimes people. Most of the melodies are old Hungarian vocal and instrumental melodies which accompany the old couple dances and solo menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº and sebes magyaros (slow and fast Hungarian), csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, kettÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœs jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rtatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ja a nd sirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼leje, and menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances; fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡hos and verbunk. The book by ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n KallÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s and GyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy Martin, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTegnap a Gyimesbe jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rtamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ presents an invaluable selection of their lament type songs.\nThe Gyimes vocabulary of dances is filled out with line dances (the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhejszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡kÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and couple dances of bourgeoise origin locally referred to as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œaprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³kÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The line dances are accompanied by melodies more of Balkan or Romanian origin with fewer tunes of Hungarian origin, whereas the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œaprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³kÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are accompanied by melodies of German or city style composed melodic origin. They do a dance imitating bears at wedding which is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmedvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (the bear dance).\nTheir singing and instrumental style of performance exhibit a characteristically strong tendency for ornamentation and variations. The richly shaped instrumental melody is not accompanied by harmony, rather by a sound from the gardon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a folk cello ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in richly varied rhythms. The first written reference to this stringed instrument which used as a rhythm instrument by hitting the strings with a wooden stick, is from the time of the principality of Transylvania (that is the 16th and 17th centuries). Today this style has largely died out in the SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©kely areas of Transylvania, but in Gyimes there are quite a few excellent gardon players still playing. One of the best amongst them, is the musician playing on this recording, JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nos TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r.\nNext to the gardon, the most important traditional instruments of the Gyimes people are the violin and two types of flutes: a typical six holed flute and the so-called two necked flute or double flute.\nThe singers, two sisters from GyimesbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼kk were always known as being good singers. They are ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°va KarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡csony and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ria KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Kutas girlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as they were called when they were young. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Kutas girls could always be heard from far away, if they were in the forest, they were always singing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This comment was heard by the writer of these lines in 1998 in the Pika Bar in BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nyospatak, from very a serious man who never would have had the occasion to have the same route through the forest as the Kutas girlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nThe life of a person from Gyimes offers endless possibilities for singing. A person can sing while walking alone in the forest, or while doing chores around the house, they can sing in the pub, at the spinning bee, at a wedding, at a ball, at a christening, at the farewell dinner for boys going into the army, at a pig butchering; they can sing on the way home on top of the hay wagon, when thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something the matter or when theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re happy about something, when theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re afraid and when theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re bored. The life of a person from Gyimes, like anyone who still lives the traditional lifestyle is permeated with music. The language system built on the songs is taught to the children like the language itself. They hear it constantly, and learn it without even realizing it, thus making the music one with their mother tongue. When they sing together it is particularly easy to feel how similarly, naturally and easily, they express the ornamentation, the rhythms and the seemingly complicated system. This can mean, a symmetrical csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s melody, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“limpingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rhythm of the lassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº magyaros, or perhaps the free talking rhythm of the lament tunes.\nIn the musical life of the Gyimes people, the flute played a big role. Viktor TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r has told me, that like the rest of the children, by the time they were 5 or 6 years old they were already spending the whole summer with their grandfather at the pasture up in the mountains where the Gyimes people keep their animals from the spring through the fall. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s when he was given his first flute. It was the general practice to give little boys their first flute upon reaching the age of five or six. And when they all went upo to the summer lodging, they all took their flutes. So itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no wonder there were so many good flute players ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ones who could make a tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbloomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, could ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œplay out the melodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ornamentation tooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œplay it into the feetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nVol5: SzilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gynagyfalu (NusfalÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™u) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SzilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gybagos (BoghiÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸). Original Village music from the SzilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g (SÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™laj): The SzilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g is located in the northwestern corner of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Transylvania. For us who consider the region primarily from the traditional instrumental folk music standpoint, SzilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g clearly belongs to the Transylvanian dialect with indications of transitional characteristics from SzatmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r, Bihar and the Great Plain areas.\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtraditional bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in this case is not only composed of the usual lead fiddle-viola-double bass. Rather the model here was the more learned sound of the city Gypsy band, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdoubleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ band (meaning 2 fiddles, 2 violas), whose second ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfirstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ violin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or second prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ often plays the third. Amongst the violas, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the three stringed viola that plays fast dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±vÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ style bowing (wherein two quarter notes are produced by one stroke of the bow, with a marked stress on each of them) for the fast dance tunes called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œugrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, while the other viola is a classically tuned, four stringed viola that plays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œesztÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡mÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoff-beatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) accompaniment. On field recordings wherein the band includes an accordion as well, the accordion plays the part of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ viola. \nThe dance music played here also reflects the transitional condition. At Hungarian events, the musicians play slow, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶regesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, and without pause, even in the middle of a melody, they change over into csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, then they may also include the previous melody in a much faster version in the fast section (which our informants referred to as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œugrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). In addition to the couple dances, two variations of menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dance are found; one known from the SzatmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r region and a type of Transylvanian legÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyes with a fast dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±vÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ bowed accompaniment called verbunk or figurÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³; but these have fallen out of the everyday repertoire of dances. For the Romanians, they play the latter under the name of FecioreÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸te, or BÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rbunc.\nOur informants knew the words to an amazing number of csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s tunes, a mixture of composed and folk songs, evidence of the celebrated appetite for singing of the people of this area. Some of the Hungarian melodies, as a result of centuries of living together, are used without concern for their origin, by Gypsies or Romanians in their own language. It might be a strange feeling for a Hungarian, when a well known Hungarian song is sung and presented as an example of a hundred years old Romanian or Gypsy folk song in the respective language of informants from those ethnic groups. In the course of our field work we have recorded many old Hungarian melodies that were no longer known or used in the Hungarian communities, but have been preserved by other ethnic groups who think of these melodies as their own.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe16c8e90a39849bc6f63c3e4330a6d5631f00e4","amp;dn":"Uj+Patria+vol+4%265+-+Village+music+from+transylvania","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe16c8e90a39849bc6f63c3e4330a6d5631f00e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,22,200,233,10,57,132,155,198,246,60,62,67,48,166,213,99,31,0,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
