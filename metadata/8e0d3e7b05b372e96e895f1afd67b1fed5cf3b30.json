Much-loved equally by alternative music fans, country aficionados and singer-songwriter buffs, the North London-based outfit stamped their maverick country-rock brand on the young Camden Town scene. Defiantly bucking UK trends of the early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s, The Rockingbirds anticipated the alt-country revolution, and sit comfortably alongside like-minded contemporaries like The Jayhawks and Uncle Tupelo. This is a re-issue of the debut album The Rockingbirds together with a second disc of rare tracks, many of which are available on CD for the first time and all of which have been re-mastered. The album will be packaged in standard jewel-case format together with a 12-page booklet featuring new photos and sleeve-notes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0d3e7b05b372e96e895f1afd67b1fed5cf3b30","amp;dn":"The+Rockingbirds+-+The+Rockingbirds+%5B1992%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0d3e7b05b372e96e895f1afd67b1fed5cf3b30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,13,62,123,5,179,114,233,110,137,95,26,253,103,177,254,213,207,59,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
