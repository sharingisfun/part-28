Examining accounts in which scientific advances clashed with Christian doctrine or biblical interpretations of the day, from Galileo and the Copernican Revolution, to the medical breakthroughs of anesthesia and inoculation, Russell points to the constant upheaval and reevaluation of our systems of belief throughout history. In turn, he identifies where similar debates between modern science and the Church still exist today. Michael Ruse's new introduction brings these conflicts between science and theology up to date, focusing on issues arising after World War II.\nThis classic is sure to interest all readers of philosophy and religion, as well as those interested in Russell's thought and writings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab3e2e340333958aa5888f6e593fc969f44dfb9","amp;dn":"Religion+and+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab3e2e340333958aa5888f6e593fc969f44dfb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,179,226,227,64,51,57,88,170,88,136,246,229,147,252,150,159,68,223,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
