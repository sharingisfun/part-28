This album has never had a CD reissue.\n\nGreat psych/pop from 1969 - pleasant tunes, and very well played, the album is a delight.  (Sadly its follow-up, four years later, was abysmal.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f6d9a1896eae37114f3f394bf03372848a4ff6","amp;dn":"Dr.+Marigold%27s+Prescription+-+Pictures+of+Life+%281969%29+%28mp3%2C+320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f6d9a1896eae37114f3f394bf03372848a4ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,246,217,161,137,110,174,55,17,79,63,57,75,240,51,114,132,138,79,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
