Soon, Sticky Fingers was voted D.C.'s best bakery by The Washington City Paper, and chef Doron Petersan found herself beating out traditional bakers on the Food Network's Cupcake Wars.\n\nSticky Fingers' Sweets is packed with one hundred of her beloved recipes- from indulgent snacks like Fudgetastic Brownies and Oatmeal Raisin Cookies to breakfast treats like Pecan Spice Coffee Cake and Cranberry Ginger Scones, and from celebratory desserts like Chocolate Seltzer Cake and Red Velvet Cupcakes to Sticky Fingers' most popular sweets- Little Devils, Cowvins, and Sticky Buns. Petersan also includes &quot;love bite&quot; nutritional tips and valuable tricks-of-the- trade techniques that every home baker will appreciate.\n\nThe number of people embracing a vegan lifestyle continues to grow. Like Erin McKenna's BabyCakes and Isa Chandra Moskowitz's bestselling cookbooks, Sticky Fingers' Sweets and Petersan's delectable-and secretly healthy-recipes will be greeted enthusiastically by anyone and everyone who loves to bake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f01230d02459ff1b20b778db6f141def114a70","amp;dn":"Sticky+Fingers%27+Sweets+-+100+Super-Secret+Vegan+Recipes+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f01230d02459ff1b20b778db6f141def114a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,240,18,48,208,36,89,255,27,32,183,120,219,111,20,29,239,17,74,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
