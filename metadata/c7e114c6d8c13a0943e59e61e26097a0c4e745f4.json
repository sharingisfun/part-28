Does 1000 points damage to the player\n* Did some patching client side to prevent duplicated entities\n* The join server page now remembers the port as well as the ip\n* Fixed a bug where joining a server on a specific port caused the client to forget all keybindings\n* Added lakes and rare lava pools, both on the surface and randomly in caves.\n* Fixed a crash bug when destroying the vehicle from under a player\n* Players connecting to a server or respawning are invulnerable for three seconds\n\n!NEW Bugs!\n* Rather than kill you, /kill turns you into a ghost. (ie. you cant die, cant pick up items and monsters won't attack you). Solution is to delete playername.dat file located in the world folder.\n\nStay tuned at Kaen-Paradise.co.cc\n\n\n=======================================================\n\nUpgrading?\n\n(Many things have changed, I *HIGHLY RECOMMEND* deleting your old\n.minecraft folder and unpacking this fresh.)\n\nBut if you wish to do a normal upgrade.\nReplace your MineCraft folder in &quot;.minecraft&quot; with this one.\nOverwrite all files.
