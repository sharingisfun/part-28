They can accurately simulate logic design, can show where to make reductions in complexity, and can be easily modified to model different scenarios. Presenting DD techniques from an applied perspective, Decision Diagram Techniques for Micro- and Nanoelectronic Design Handbook provides a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of DD techniques. Experts with more than forty years of combined experience in both industrial and academic settings demonstrate how to apply the techniques to full advantage with more than 400 examples and illustrations. Beginning with the fundamental theory, data structures, and logic underlying DD techniques, they explore a breadth of topics from arithmetic and word-level representations to spectral techniques and event-driven analysis. The book also includes abundant references to more detailed information and additional applications. Decision Diagram Techniques for Micro- and Nanoelectronic Design Handbook collects the theory, methods, and practical knowledge necessary to design more advanced circuits and places it at your fingertips in a single, concise reference.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c84429fb1bf05d972d0dcb81a94faefda500a40","amp;dn":"Decision+Diagram+Techniques+for+Micro-+and+Nanoelectronic+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c84429fb1bf05d972d0dcb81a94faefda500a40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,132,66,159,177,191,5,217,114,208,220,184,26,148,250,239,218,80,10,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
