It not only covers how to do things, but also why they work the way they do.\n\nLightroom may have a mind of its own... but now you can learn how it thinks.\n\nThe story behind the book... and a FREE bonus!\n\nThe Adobe Lightroom - The Missing FAQ series was originally intended to be a searchable PDF eBook, however once the book was released to the public, a demand arose for other formats too. Anyone purchasing this Kindle version is invited to contact the author via her website to access the main color PDF format, ePub format, and any future LR3 Kindle updates absolutely FREE.\n\n**SCREENSHOT QUALITY - Thanks to Karol for pointing out the problem with the screenshots being too small to read in the first release. The file has now been rebuilt with maximum size images which are much clearer. Anyone who has already purchased is welcome to contact the author for the update.** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30f96f37266a1594e69404d256e9eb1d98a3c9e5","amp;dn":"Adobe+Lightroom+3+-+The+Missing+FAQ+-++by+Victoria+Bampton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30f96f37266a1594e69404d256e9eb1d98a3c9e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,249,111,55,38,106,21,148,230,148,4,210,86,233,235,29,152,163,201,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
