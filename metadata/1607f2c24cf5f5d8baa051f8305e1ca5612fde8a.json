First published in 1950, it is presently in its seventeenth edition (published in February 2008). Although it is aimed at all members of the medical profession, it is mainly used by internists and junior doctors in this field, as well as medical students.\n\nThe work is named after Tinsley R. Harrison of Birmingham, Alabama, who served as editor-in-chief of the first five editions and established the format of the work - a strong basis of clinical medicine interwoven with an understanding of pathophysiology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1607f2c24cf5f5d8baa051f8305e1ca5612fde8a","amp;dn":"Harrison+17th+RETAIL+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1607f2c24cf5f5d8baa051f8305e1ca5612fde8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,7,242,194,76,245,245,216,186,160,81,248,48,94,28,165,97,47,222,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
