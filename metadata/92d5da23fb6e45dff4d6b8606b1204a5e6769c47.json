The magazine focuses on country music stars and events, and regularly features exclusive interviews with recording artists and country music news.[3] Country Weekly also cosponsored the CMT/TNN Country Weekly Music Awards, at the time the only nationally televised country music awards show that allowed fans to vote for the winners.[4]\n\nIn February 2009, Country Weekly reverted to a weekly magazine, having been issued fortnightly since 1999. The magazine also dropped subscriptions at that point (which it has since reinstated), and changed its logo.[5]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d5da23fb6e45dff4d6b8606b1204a5e6769c47","amp;dn":"Country+Weekly+-+28+July+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d5da23fb6e45dff4d6b8606b1204a5e6769c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,213,218,35,251,110,69,223,244,214,184,96,107,18,4,165,230,118,156,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
