No Need To Argue\n\n  With their surprise success behind them, the Cranberries went ahead and essentially created a sequel to Everybody Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We with only tiny variations, with mixed results. The fact that the album is essentially a redo of previously established stylistic ground isn't apparent in just the production, handled again by Stephen Street, or the overall sound, or even that one particularly fine song is called &quot;Dreaming My Dreams.&quot; Everybody wasn't a laugh riot, to be sure, but No Need to Argue starts to see O'Riordan take a more commanding and self-conscious role that ended up not standing the band in good stead later. Lead single &quot;Zombie&quot; is the offender in this regard -- the heavy rock trudge isn't immediately suited for the band's strengths (notably, O'Riordan wrote this without Noel Hogan) -- while the subject matter (the continuing Northern Ireland tensions) ends up sounding trivialized. Opening cut &quot;Ode to My Family&quot; is actually one of the band's best, with a lovely string arrangement created by O'Riordan, her overdubbed vocals showing her distinct vocal tics. Where No Need succeeds best is when the Cranberries stick at what they know, resulting in a number of charmers like &quot;Twenty One,&quot; the uilleann pipes-touched &quot;Daffodil's Lament,&quot; which has an epic sweep that doesn't overbear like &quot;Zombie,&quot; and the evocative &quot;Disappointment.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf58d07af207c56467a804d8ed19aad0065b71e","amp;dn":"The+Cranberries+-+No+Need+to+Argue+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf58d07af207c56467a804d8ed19aad0065b71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,245,141,7,175,32,124,86,70,122,128,77,142,209,154,173,0,101,183,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
