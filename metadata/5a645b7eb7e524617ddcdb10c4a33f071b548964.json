The policy has served Lucy well all through high school, so when her best friend Ellie gets sick before prom and begs her to step in as ColeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s date, she accepts with a smile, silencing about ten different reservations. Like the one where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather stay home shredding online zombies. And the one where she hates playing dress-up. And especially the one where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been secretly in love with Cole since the dawn of time.\n\nWhen Cole surprises her at the after party with a kiss under the stars, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything Lucy has ever dreamed ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and the biggest BFF deal-breaker ever. Despite ColeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lingering sweetness, Lucy knows theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to Ã¢â‚¬â„¢fess up to Ellie. But before they get the chance, LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Facebook profile mysteriously explodes with compromising pics of her and Cole, along with tons of other studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ party indiscretions. Tagged. Liked. And furiously viral.\n\nBy Monday morning, LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been branded a slut, a backstabber, and a narc, mired in a tabloid-worthy scandal just weeks before graduation.\n\nLucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been battling undead masses online long enough to know thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one way to survive a disaster of this magnitude: Stand up and fight. Game plan? Uncover and expose the Facebook hacker, win back her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trust, and graduate with a clean slate.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one snagÃ¢â‚¬â€Cole. Turns out LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the only one whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been harboring unrequited love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a645b7eb7e524617ddcdb10c4a33f071b548964","amp;dn":"%23scandal+by+Sarah+Ockler+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a645b7eb7e524617ddcdb10c4a33f071b548964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,100,91,126,183,229,36,97,125,220,219,16,196,163,63,7,27,84,137,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
