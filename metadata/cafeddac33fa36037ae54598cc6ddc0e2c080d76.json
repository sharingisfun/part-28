Although barely a year old,\nthey have already established themselves on the live circuit with a showcase at\nlast years legendary OYA Festival and recent touring with Kvelertak, Gallows,\nPurified In Blood and Blood Command. Extensive domestic radio play followed off\nthe back of a stunning demo and debut 7? vinyl.\n\nWith ex-members from such notable Norwegian acts as Amulet, Infidels Forever, JR\nEwing and Silver, the band are no strangers to dedicated hard work. Drawing\ninfluence from artists such as Planes Mistaken For Stars, Drive Like Jehu, Hot\nWater Music and the Afghan Whigs, the mission is clear: Wolves Like Us are here\nto make the urgent, powerful new music that they love.\n\nWOLVES LIKE US have just finished recording their debut album, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Late Love,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\nwhich is set for release in the fall of this year on Prosthetic Records. Alan\nDouches will be handling mastering duties and Justin Bartlett will be crafting\nthe artwork. A main stage slot at this years OYA Festival has just been\nconfirmed, with a lot more to be announced shortly.\n\nWOLVES LIKE US drummer Jonas Thire commented, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´WLU are honoured to sign with\nProsthetic and be a part of a label with so many great bands. Even if we are a\nslightly more melodic outfit, we all share the passion for HC, metal and hard\nrock which is what we grew up listening to. We also had a wish to sign with an\ninternational label and the fact that our album(s) will be available around the\nworld means a lot to us. Looking forward to the years to come and a great\nrelationship!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nWatch with anticipation as the release of WOLVES LIKE USs newest album ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Late\nLoveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ quickly approaches.\n\nBuy it :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://prostheticrecords.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://prostheticrecords.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cafeddac33fa36037ae54598cc6ddc0e2c080d76","amp;dn":"Wolves+Like+Us-Late+Love-2011-SDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cafeddac33fa36037ae54598cc6ddc0e2c080d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,254,221,172,51,250,54,3,122,229,69,152,204,109,220,14,44,8,13,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
