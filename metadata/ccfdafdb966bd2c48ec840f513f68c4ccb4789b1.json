Even being the adopted daughter of a revered cop couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep AbbieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled past from making her a misfit in the working-class Irish American enclave of South Buffalo. And now, despite a Harvard degree and a police detectiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s badge, she still struggles to earn the respect and trust of those sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sworn to protect. But all that may change, once the killing starts.\n\nWhen Jimmy RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mangled corpse is found in a local church basement, this sadistic sacrilege sends a bone-deep chill through the winter-whipped city. It also seems to send a messageÃ¢â‚¬â€one that Abbie believes only the fiercely secretive citizens of the neighborhood known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the CountyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ understand. But in a town ruled by an old-world code of silence and secrecy, her search for answers is stonewalled at every turn, even by fellow cops. Only when Abbie finds a lead at the Gaelic Club, where war stories, gossip, and confidences flow as freely as the drink, do tongues begin to wagÃ¢â‚¬â€with desperate warnings and dire threats. And when the killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysterious calling card appears on her own doorstep, the hunt takes a shocking twist into her own familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past. As the grisly murders and grim revelations multiply, Abbie wages a chilling battle of wits with a maniac who sees into her soul, and she swears to expose the CountyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden historyÃ¢â‚¬â€one bloody body at a time.\n\nWith Black Irish, Stephen Talty stakes a place beside Jo NesbÃƒÂ¸, John Sandford, and Tana French on the cutting edge of psychological crime thrillers.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccfdafdb966bd2c48ec840f513f68c4ccb4789b1","amp;dn":"Stephan+Talty+-+Black+Irish+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccfdafdb966bd2c48ec840f513f68c4ccb4789b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,253,175,219,150,107,210,196,142,200,64,245,19,246,140,76,203,71,137,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
