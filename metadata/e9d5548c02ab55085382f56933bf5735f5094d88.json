At least that is what the Mayan calendar would have us believe.\n&quot;The so-called gods--the extraterrestrials--willcome again. We're headed for a 'god shock' of major proportions.\n&quot;But doesn't anyone with half a brain know that interstellar travel is simply impossible because of the sheer distances involved? And that extraterrestrials would never look like us?\n&quot;Well, dear readers, I destroy these preconceptions. Systematically. One bit at a time.&quot;\nIn his own inimitable way, Erich von Daniken picks these preconceptions and prejudices apart with a clarity no other author could manage.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  google TEAM NANBAN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9d5548c02ab55085382f56933bf5735f5094d88","amp;dn":"Twilight+of+the+Gods-The+Mayan+Calendar+and+the+Return+of+the+Ex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9d5548c02ab55085382f56933bf5735f5094d88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,213,84,140,2,171,85,8,83,130,245,105,51,191,87,53,245,9,77,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
