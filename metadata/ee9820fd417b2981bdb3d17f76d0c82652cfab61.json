Most indivduals don't think of the flute as a jazz instrument, but Herbie proves them wrong. This collection showcases Mann's different moods,including his interesting &quot;The Evolution of Mann&quot;. A good first buy CD, that will open you up to other of his music. ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nWhile recording for Verve records in the late '50's Herbie Mann's music reflected a decidedly Latin bent. This was a very good thing! The flute, especially Herbie's flute, lends itself well to this genre. He single-handidly popularized the instrument and this collection of tunes provides a good example of how he did it. Besides the Latin-tinged numbers, there's also a fair share of standards. His versions of &quot;Stardust&quot; and &quot;You Stepped Out of a Dream&quot; are particularly beautiful. ~ Glenn R.
