The band wrote and recorded eight\nsongs at Headley Grange which, when combined, stretched the album\nbeyond the typical length of an LP. This prompted the band to make\nPhysical Graffiti a double album by including previously unreleased\ntracks from earlier recording sessions. &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was\nLed Zeppelin's second most commercially successful release, selling\neight million copies in the United States alone.\n\nPhysical Graffiti was commercially and critically successful; the\nalbum went 16x platinum in the US in 2006, signifying shipments of\neight million copies\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/97325378907990629512.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/97325378907990629512.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Format: FLAC\nCodec: FLAC\nNumber of Albums: 02\nNumber of Tracks: 15\nChannels: 2 Channels Stereo / 44100 Hz\nQuality: [FLAC avg. bitrate: 888 kbps]\nAlbum Title: Physical Graffiti\nArtist / Group: Led Zeppelin\nAlbum Release Year: 1975 / 1993\nArtwork: Embedded Within Audio Files\nGenre: Hard rock / Heavy metal / Blues rock / Folk rock\nTotal Size: 444 MB [466,585,201 bytes]\nTotal Duration: 1:22:43.133 [218 874 180 samples]\nTall: Reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 3 - Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip\nIncluded: &quot;Scand Artwork&quot; Checksum files .MD5 .FFP With Trader's Little Helper\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15ceb6d0e24c3e8bf13370028dcc018b4016863a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Physical+Graffiti+%5B1975%5D+1993+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15ceb6d0e24c3e8bf13370028dcc018b4016863a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,206,182,208,226,76,62,139,241,51,112,2,141,204,1,139,64,22,134,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
