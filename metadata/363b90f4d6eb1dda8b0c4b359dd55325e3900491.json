This twelve-track sophomore effort included the glam-stomp of 'The Box', 'Everybody Please Relax' and the single '59' (the video of which was shot on the number 59 bus around Glasgow). It boasted a beefier, harmony-driven sound, whilst maintaining the band's trademark style and wit. Kicks also featured a guest turn from former The Long Blondes singer Kate Jackson, who lent backing vocals to the track &quot;Kickstrasse.&quot; NME wrote that &quot;like Supergrass and British Sea Power before them, 1990s' refusal to be difficult and consistent greatness makes them a hard concept to market. But a fantastic one to listen to.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:363b90f4d6eb1dda8b0c4b359dd55325e3900491","amp;dn":"1990s+-+Kicks+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"363b90f4d6eb1dda8b0c4b359dd55325e3900491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,59,144,244,214,235,29,218,139,12,75,53,157,213,83,37,227,144,4,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
