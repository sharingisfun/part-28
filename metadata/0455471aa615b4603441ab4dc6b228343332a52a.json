Each member of this group has a freaky look that would lead you to believe this band is going to play some variation of black metal. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿Luckily, there are no helium vocals, Cookie Monster growls or any Satan-worshiping lyrics that will cause you to roll your eyes. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s MySpace page gave me a clue they might not sound like what the look like since thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s where they claim influences ranging from Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Slayer, Rush, Korn and Pink Floyd! The end result of all those influences is an album that delivers power metal more than anything else alongside some elements of trash, prog and NWOBHM.\n\nYears in the making, Crawling Out Of Hell is a concept album (the first in a planned trilogy) based on the novel of the same name that was written by the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitarist/producer John Cruppe. Included in the CD booklet is some pretty cool art work and snippets of the story explaining what is going on. For any album itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a well put together package but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even more impressive given that it is self-released. Also of note is the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other guitarist Robb Lotta who has worked with Anthrax singer Joey Belladonna in the past and lead vocalist Steve Seniuk who does an amazing job throughout the album with a number of vocal ranges.\n\nAt twenty tracks, this album can be a bit overwhelming but it is really not too bad when you keep in mind that six of these songs are instrumentals that clock in at two minutes or less. Personally, whenever a band releases a concept piece, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m less concerned with whatever story theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re trying to tell and more focused on the music. Hey, if you can tie if all together and make the pieces fit thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great but I want good music first and foremost. Not that I have to tell Fallen Angel that. Hey, look, a concept album that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t dull itself and get lost in effects and trying to build atmosphere! Other than the few short instrumental breaks, this album gallops from start to finish with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDark LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ being my personal favorite. Seniuk really shines on that song, I think. Another favorite of mine is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe AnswerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which is a very good ballad that reminds me of Queensryche at times.\n\nOverall, Crawling Out Of Hell is a solid debut that has much in common with classic metal bands of the past. This is definitely a band to keep an eye on. Now bring on those sequels!\n\nHighlights: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSinnerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s VengeanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDark LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe One Who Walks AloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe AnswerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLeaving It All BehindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrant Me PeaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nFallen Angel At MySpace\n\n\n\nAn epic saga three years in the making - &quot;Fallen Angel - Crawling Out Of Hell&quot; and it's companion novel of the same title is stirring up the Heavy Metal industry everywhere!
