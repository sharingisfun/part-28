With his characteristic hope and humor, McKenna examined time and its mysteries, the nature of language, the techniques of ecstasy, high technology and virtual cyberspace, the role of hallucinogenic plants in shamanism and the evolution of human cultures, and the foundations of post-modern spirituality. The lecture and discussion was a didactic, syncretic, challenging, eclectic, eidetic, and irreverent intellectual adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b8b78941c9e8685bce545730f55288588ce6992","amp;dn":"Terence+McKenna+-+Dreaming+Awake+At+The+End+Of+Time+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b8b78941c9e8685bce545730f55288588ce6992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,139,120,148,28,158,134,133,188,229,69,115,15,85,40,133,136,206,105,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
