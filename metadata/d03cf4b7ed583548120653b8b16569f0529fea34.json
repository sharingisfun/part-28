Lead singer Jason Aplin, sounding like a dead ringer for Menswear vocalist Johnny Dean, adds a bit of a biting sarcasm to each of the 16 tracks. While not particularly hook-filled apart from the four singles, the songs are first rate aggressive singalongs that recall the glory days of Brit-pop that, at this point, were nearly two years in the past. &quot;Mum's Gone to Iceland&quot; was an appealing slice of punchy power-pop that became a U.K. Top 40 hit and is one of the highlights on this disc, along with &quot;If You Met Me Then You'd Like Me.&quot; For a Brit-pop fan, this is a very memorable release that, for the most part, received little acknowledgment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d03cf4b7ed583548120653b8b16569f0529fea34","amp;dn":"Bennet+-+Super+Natural+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d03cf4b7ed583548120653b8b16569f0529fea34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,60,244,183,237,88,53,72,18,6,83,184,177,101,105,240,82,159,234,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
