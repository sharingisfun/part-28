Edmund Lowe stars as suave Frank Chandler, better known \nto his enemies as Chandu the Magician. Though he tries to keep his supernatural \npowers a secret from his beloved sister Dorothy (Virginia Hammond), niece Betty \nLou (June Vlasek, aka June Lang) and nephew Bobby (Nestor Aber), Chandu&amp;#039;s hand \nis forced by megalomaniacal villain Roxor (Bela Lugosi at his ripest). Holding \nDorothy&amp;#039;s scientist husband Robert Regent (H. B. Walthall) captive, Roxor hopes \nto force Regent to reveal the secret of his death ray (created, of course, &quot;for \nthe good of mankind&quot;) by kidnapping the scientist&amp;#039;s wife and kids. Chandu \nmanages to remain one step ahead of Roxor, performing all manner of miraculous \nmagical feats to confound his enemy, but even our hero temporarily falls victim \nto the villain&amp;#039;s machinations when Roxor abducts Chandu&amp;#039;s sweetheart, Princess \nNadji (Irene Ware). The production-design expertise of co-director William \nCameron Menzies is never so obvious than when Chandu and his friends are \nsubjected to the various serial-like perils imposed upon them by Roxor; some of \nthese cliffhangers would seem to have been the inspiration for similar \nsituations in Steven Spielberg&amp;#039;s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Counterpointing the \nexcitement is the comedy relief of Herbert Mundin, cast as a bibulous valet who \nis bedeviled by a remonstrative, pint-sized &quot;alter ego.&quot; Two years after Chandu \nthe Magician, the film&amp;#039;s villain, Bela Lugosi, was offered the rare opportunity \nto play the heroic Frank Chandler himself in the exhilarating 12-part serial The \nReturn of Chandu.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTRIVIA:\n\n    *  This movie was based on &quot;Chandu the Magician,&quot; a radio show that was \nairing at the time. Chandu was the basis for many of the later magician \ncharacters, including DC&amp;#039;s Sandor the Mystic and Marvel Comics&amp;#039;s Dr. Strange.\n    * Nigel De Brulier&amp;#039;s yogi was the model for the sorcerer in Disney&amp;#039;s &quot;The \nSorcerer&amp;#039;s Apprentice.&quot;\n    * In the subsequent Chandu serial, producers promoted Lugosi to the role of \nthe magician-yogi.\n    * Henry B. Walthall replaced Ralph Morgan as Regent.\n    * Cost-conscious Fox studios paid $40,000 for the rights to Chandu. Lugosi \nreceived $2500, Ware $1250, Hammond $100, Walthall $1000, and Suart $300.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSOME REVIEWS:\n\nA.D.S, New York Times, October 1, 1932\n\nThis is hocus-pocus week at the Roxy, where most of the photographic tricks \nknown to Hollywood have been assembled to startle and confound the enemies of \nChandu. Under the persuasive eyes of the quondam magician of the radio, good \nEnglish rifles crumple and turn into snapping vipers, ropes up-end themselves in \nthe air, souls rise out of bodies and bodies absent themselves out of their \nclothes. For ChanduÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Edmund Lowe in Oriental dressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is an adept in the mystic arts \nof the Yogi, and not all the powers of darkness, abetted by tear gas, poison, \ntrapdoors, collapsible dungeon floors and the great mad Roxor himself, can \nprevail against those eyes.\n\nOn the radio the nightly recital of Chandu&amp;#039;s adventures contrived, in the \nwell-remembered manner of Pauline and Elmo the Mighty, to open with an escape \nfrom an impossible dilemma and to close with a plunge into a more impossible \none. Not unexpectedly, this screen version has the same clutter of climaxes from \nwhich the great Chandu emerges every five minutes with the same facility. The \nresult is whooping entertainment for the children and a series of naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯vely \njuvenile escapades for the grown-ups.\n\nRoxor, a baleful character whose behavior may be described with the simple \ninformation that Bela Lugosi plays the part, is a madman who wants to possess \nhimself of a death ray and destroy the world. The ray is the invention of a \ncertain Robert Regent, traveling in Egypt with his family. Chandu, an adventurer \nturned Yogi, shows up in time to prevent the annihilation of the entire family \nand to battle Roxor all over Egypt in the process of saving the world from \nextinction. Although Chandu, like a good Yogi, is indifferent to all earthly \nthings, his indifference does not keep him from loving and ultimately wedding \nthe Princess Nadji, another imperiled damsel.\n\nIn one episode Chandu is manacled, bundled into a weighted coffin and dropped to \nthe bottom of the Nile, whence he rises safely after a sufficiently harrowing \nstruggle. Herbert Mundin, as the drunken and gullible orderly of the mystic, \nprovides some badly needed humor. Mr. Lugosi&amp;#039;s familiar tactics of terrorization \nseem overstated. Irene Ware, a newcomer, makes a charming juvenile as the \nPrincess.\n\nA feature of the stage show is an effective arrangement of Kol Nidre, rendered \nby William Robyn and a large chorus. &quot;Box o&amp;#039; Tricks&quot; and &quot;Dance Away the Night&quot; \nare the other stage pageants.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRaymond Valinoti, Jr.  IMDB, May 27th 2000\n\nIf you like old-fashioned cliffhanger thrills, you&amp;#039;ll enjoy CHANDU THE MAGICIAN. \nIt has everything you could want in a serial adventure- a dashing hero, a \nmegalomaniacal villain, an exotic setting, and a series of hair-raising perils \nthat keeps the scenario rolling until the end. CHANDU&amp;#039;s plot which concerns the \ntitle character&amp;#039;s supernatural efforts to prevent the fiendish Roxor from taking \nover the world is trite and simplistic. However, the story&amp;#039;s very triteness and \nsimplicity is part of CHANDU&amp;#039;s corny charm.\n\nCHANDU boasts dazzling set design and fluid cinematography that create a \nfascinating, mysterious Egyptian milieu with majestic temple sets and an \natmospheric desert locale. CHANDU&amp;#039;s sense of adventure and mystique is further \nenhanced by special effects illustrating the powers of both Chandu and a death \nray Roxor plans to employ in his world-domination plot. Even by today&amp;#039;s \nIndustrial Light and Magic standards, these effects look impressive.\n\nEdmund Lowe is acceptable in the title role of Chandu but Bela Lugosi in the \nrole of Roxor steals the film. Lugosi tackles his part with a demonic zeal, \ndisplaying odious glee over his scheme in both his facial expressions and line \ndeliveries. There is little restraint or subtlety in his performance, but Lugosi \nprojects such persuasive charisma that one can forgive his indulgences. Overall, \nCHANDU is no classic, but it&amp;#039;s fun escapist entertainment. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
