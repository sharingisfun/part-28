The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942Ã¢â‚¬â€œ43 for its historical setting. It stars William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa. The movie was filmed in Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka). The bridge in the film was located near Kitulgala.\n\nThe film achieved near-universal critical acclaim, winning seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards, and in 1997 this film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nSource: Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a6e7857c83c7d72c43da8b90d332217116e344","amp;dn":"The+Bridge+on+the+River+Kwai+-+BrRip+720p+Avi+-+Skypeak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a6e7857c83c7d72c43da8b90d332217116e344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,166,231,133,124,131,199,215,44,67,218,139,144,211,50,33,113,22,227,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
