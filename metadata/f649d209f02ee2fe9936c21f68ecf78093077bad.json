Detroit-born, Florida-raised Dennis Yost, who joined on drums and moved into the singer's spot, came from a Jacksonville-area band called the Echoes; he was just old enough to remember '50s R&amp;B when it was current and, among many other groups, loved the Five Satins; and in addition to playing the skins, he sometimes liked to sing when the calls came for a '50s number like &quot;In the Still of the Night.&quot; After his own group broke up in the mid-'60s, Yost joined a band called Leroy &amp; the Moments, which included Wally Eaton (bass, vocals), James Cobb (guitar), and Joe Wilson (keyboards). His arrival, along with the changing times, also signaled a change in the group's name -- as there was no &quot;Leroy&quot; anyway, that could go, and the Moments was already taken, so, taking their lead from Yost's Classic-model drum kit, they became the Classics.\n\nTheir sound was extremely diverse by all accounts -- they could cover most of the Top 40 note-perfect, which was ideal for audiences in Jacksonville but didn't necessarily give them much to work with as a recording act. Part of their act included a tribute to the Four Seasons, who were still burning up the charts in those days -- ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifqxqw5ldte~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifqxqw5ldte~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe 27-song Best of Dennis Yost &amp; the Classics IV compilation, originally released through Capitol-EMI's &quot;Legendary Masters Series,&quot; pretty well covers the essentials of the Classics IV's history, from their early post-doo wop releases, emulating the Four Seasons and the Diamonds, to their smoother, subtler contemporary pop sound, established by &quot;Spooky&quot; and maintained through the hits &quot;Stormy&quot; and &quot;Traces.&quot; The sound is good, though there's room for improvement from the early-'90s-vintage digital mastering, and the collection is comprehensive to the point of including a few unreleased tracks, on top of the hits and B-sides. And the annotation comes up to this series' usual standard of excellence.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:knfrxql0ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:knfrxql0ldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000063COV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000063COV&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
