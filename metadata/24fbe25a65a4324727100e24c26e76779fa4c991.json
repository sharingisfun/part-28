Their style ranges from the sweeping, often epic, guitar pop sound to the visceral and angular. Critics have likened their sound to a variety of groups, from The Cure and Joy Division to the Pixies and Arcade Fire. The band are famed for their live performances and their choice of unusual locations for some of their shows. British Sea Power's members are Yan (Scott Wilkinson, vocals, guitar), Noble (Martin Noble, guitar), Hamilton (Neil Hamilton Wilkinson, bass guitar, vocals, guitar), Wood (Matthew Wood, drums), Phil Sumner (cornet, keyboards) and Abi Fry (viola).
