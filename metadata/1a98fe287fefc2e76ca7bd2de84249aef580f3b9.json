This a collection of early Batman Beyond comics, when the show was still on the air and the character had not been introduced into the regular DC continuity. The art style and tone are very much based on the animated series, and the material doesn't take itself too seriously. DC first did a 6 issue miniseries (v1) to test the waters and see how popular the character was, and when that sold like gangbusters they followed it up with a two year ongoing (v2), as well as the Return of the Joker film adaptation one-shot. All of those are included in this package, all in Digital format courtesy of AnHeroGold. Thanks to them for their great work, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a98fe287fefc2e76ca7bd2de84249aef580f3b9","amp;dn":"Batman+Beyond+v1+01-06%2C+v2+01-24+%2B+ROTJ+%281999-2001%7CDigital%7CAHG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a98fe287fefc2e76ca7bd2de84249aef580f3b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,152,254,40,127,239,194,231,108,167,189,45,232,66,73,174,245,128,243,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
