Obsessed with the curse, Philippe starts wasting away and dies shortly afterward.\n\nWith PhilippeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eldest son, Louis X, on the throne, Robert of Artois intensifies his scheming to reclaim the County of Artois from his aunt Mahaut. To gain the support and trust of the new king, he allies himself with the kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncle Charles of Valois and plots to undermine the once influential chamberlain, Enguerrand de Marigny.\nKing Louis seeks a new wife to provide him with an heir and ensure the succession, but is hindered by the fact he is still married to Marguerite of Burgundy, who has been imprisoned for adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair. Furthermore, a new pope has not been elected and so his marriage cannot be annulled.\n\nHe sends Robert of Artois to Marguerite in an attempt to coerce her into writing a letter stating that their marriage was never consummated and that her daughter is illegitimate. She writes the letter, but the king does not receive it, and another solution must be foundÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSubtitles by SBS Australia TV.\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18a4ac905b89d726b22a190395a633f53cc6d33","amp;dn":"The+Accursed+Kings+%282005%29+Eng+Subs-+Part+2+The+Strangled+Queen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f18a4ac905b89d726b22a190395a633f53cc6d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,138,74,201,5,184,157,114,107,34,161,144,57,90,99,63,83,204,109,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
