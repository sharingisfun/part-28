Reed runs the gamut of orchestral and multi-textural jazz to bluegrass and down-and-dirty funk, it will slip into your heart after one listen.\n\nDrawing on blues, rock, funk and jazz influences among others, Reed weaves and melds genres, rhythms and textures to produce a signature sound that has been likened by critics to Jimi Hendrix for its emotional power and stylistic creativity. Reeds vast range of explosively original music will forever change your expectation of a guitarist. Reed attacks the entire instrument in a never-ending search for the orchestra he knows is lurking inside. His two hands racing up and down the fretboard in a storm of tappings, slappings and hammerings to create a rock/jazz rhythm section, melody line and chordal accompaniment simultaneously. He riffs with the conviction and guts of a rock band, yet plays with the subtlety of that most delicate of jazz pianists, Bill Evans. There are no fancy gadgets or gimmicky FX - just 6 strings (or occasionally 12), two hands and a daring and innovative musical imagination that crosses all boundaries.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9262c6904bb391f796c5c0a241439ce5a8174a4e","amp;dn":"Preston+Reed+-+Metal%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9262c6904bb391f796c5c0a241439ce5a8174a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,98,198,144,75,179,145,247,150,197,192,162,65,67,156,229,168,23,74,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
