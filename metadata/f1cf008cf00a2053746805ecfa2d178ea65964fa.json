The series contains rare interviews with people who took part in the events described. This torrent includes all 7 episodes plus the 3-volume VHS jacket covers:\n\nEpisodes\n\n1 The Battle of the Beams (Runtime: 49 minutes 56 seconds)\n     How radio beams were used by the German Air Force to guide bombers to their targets, their discovery and the countermeasures employed.\n\n2 To See for a Hundred Miles (Runtime: 50 minutes 30 seconds)\n     The story of wartime radar as used by both the British and Germans to counter the bomber threat.\n\n3 Terror Weapons (Runtime: 49 minutes 16 seconds)\n     The story of the V1 and V2, their discovery by the allies and how they were eventually combated.\n\n4 If... (Runtime: 49 minutes 54 seconds)\n     Strange inventions and ideas that might have made an impact on the war.\n\n5 The Deadly Waves (Runtime: 49 minutes 55 seconds)\n     The battle against the magnetic mine and how it might have won the war before it began.\n\n6 Still Secret (Runtime: 49 minutes 46 seconds)\n     The story of Enigma and the ultra secret.\n\n7 The Battle of the Atlantic (Runtime: 49 minutes 21 seconds)\n     The scientific contribution to the battle.\n\nThe Secret War Vol. 1 Cover.jpg\nThe Secret War Vol. 2 Cover.jpg\nThe Secret War Vol. 3 Cover.jpg\n\nThis is my VHSrip and I think all the episodes are pretty good quality. Though the series is dated as well as some of the war information it presents, I believe it still has a very fresh quality to it that will spur you to watch it again and again - I know I have! Please enjoy! ;-)\n\nVideo: DivX mpeg4, 720 x 544 (4:3), 29.97 fps (NTSC), 2636 kbps \nAudio: mp3, stereo, 48000 Hz, 256 kbps \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1cf008cf00a2053746805ecfa2d178ea65964fa","amp;dn":"The+Secret+War+%28BBC+1977-78+VHSrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1cf008cf00a2053746805ecfa2d178ea65964fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,207,0,140,240,10,32,83,116,104,5,236,250,45,23,142,166,89,100,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
