(Pan Stanford, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nAfter a brief introduction to the fundamental properties of graphene, this book focuses on synthesis, characterization and application of various types of two-dimensional (2D) nanocarbons ranging from single/few layer graphene to carbon nanowalls and graphene oxides. Three major synthesis techniques are covered: epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC, chemical synthesis of graphene on metal, and chemical vapor deposition of vertically aligned carbon nanosheets or nanowalls. One chapter is dedicated to characterization of 2D nanocarbon using Raman spectroscopy. It provides extensive coverage for applications of 2D carbon in energy storage including supercapacitor, lithium ion battery and fuel cells","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e8e3387ffb42397b92e8b705fd873cdb5d41888","amp;dn":"Two-Dimensional+Carbon+-+Yihong+Wu+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e8e3387ffb42397b92e8b705fd873cdb5d41888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,142,51,135,255,180,35,151,185,46,139,112,95,216,115,205,181,212,24,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
