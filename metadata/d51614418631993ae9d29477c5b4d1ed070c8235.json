Jamais Cascio looks at some specific tools and techniques that can make a difference. It's a fascinating talk that might just inspire you to act.\n\nUnlike the scores of futurists peddling nightmare scenarios of global catastrophe and social meltdown, Jamais Cascio proposes a different, often surprising alternative: What if human beings, and all of our technology, could actually manage to change things for the better? The strangely plausible worlds Cascio imagines far outstrip conventional thinking: worlds in which surveillance is universal, networks are embedded in all aspects of life, and the Web augments our very eyesight. But rather than focusing on the obvious Orwellian aspects of these looming changes, Cascio suggests that the rapid democratization of these technologies will be empowering rather than enslaving.\n\nCascio is the co-founder of WorldChanging.com, a blog devoted to developing pathways to a &quot;bright green&quot; future. Since 2006, he has made his online home at OpenTheFuture.com. Recently, he was part of Superstruct, part of the Institute for the Future's 2009 Ten-Year Forecast. He's now working on a set of 50-year scenarios that will serve as framing material for the TYF &amp; Superstruct content. He's also at work on a book on the use of foresight as a way of dealing with periods of significant uncertainty and change.\n\n    &quot;My worst-case scenario is us continuing to have short-term-track thinking.&quot;\n\nJamais Cascio, wired.com, March 10, 2008\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
