I have read the best books and attended many of the most popular training courses across the industry. But I have to say that the OpenTrader Professional Training Program is a totally different ball game. It is the most powerful and comprehensive training program I've ever come across in 5 years of searching. In fact, I believe that this is the first time ever that this kind of pro training is available for independent retail traders. It's like getting a university degree in trading. I give it 5/5 stars.&quot; \n\n- Mani K., San Ramon, CA, USA\n\nTrade Like The Professionals\n\nNot all trading methods are created equal. We trade using what has been called the most statistically robust analysis method ever created: Auction Market Theory. We utilize volume profile to exploit a dimension of market action that most traders are unaware of, and we combine this with price action principles to create a complete method grounded in the realities of market dynamics. You learn the exact same methods we've used to make a living from trading the markets full-time, and you can use these methods to trade any market on any time-frame. Once you've experienced this robust method in action, you'll see its sheer superiority to all other methods you've learned.\nNo indicators. No systems. Just strategies with a real edge.\n\nOnce you can trade without any indicators or mechanical signals, that's when you know you've arrived as a trader. We teach you to shed all the indicators that have never really worked for you, and learn how to read the market contextually. You learn to take advantage of the movements of other traders; to know who's in control of the market; to gauge where the important moves will start ahead of time. Your trading will be on an entirely different level once you make this transition, and your results will start speaking for themselves.\nSave Years and Thousands of Dollars\n\nMost traders spend years of effort with nothing to show for it at the end. If you've gone through this, not only is it frustrating, but the people closest to you lose faith in you and worst of all it makes you lose faith in yourself. By learning proven trading methods directly from the professionals themselves, you avoid years of needless struggle, confusion, and wrong paths that only end up depleting your account and taking your dream away from you.\n\nStrategy &amp; Tactics\n\nTo have an edge in the markets, you have to have a clear strategy that is finely tuned to market realities. The beauty of our strategy is its exquisitely simplicity and ability to be in tune with the movement of the market. It keeps you on the side of the big money players, and gives you the potential to profit from virtually any market condition. You can finally avoid getting pushed around by market noise, and getting chopped up by trading in the wrong zones at the wrong times.\nSetups &amp; Execution\n\nOnce the market is open it's easy to feel overwhelmed, lost, and confused, even if you have a good overall strategy. We teach you the elite skills of dynamically reading a live market to allow you to implement your strategy correctly and efficiently. We also go into the nuances of execution, teaching you all the professional tricks of the trade, while detailing every setup, entry, and exit technique we employ. If you regularly watch the market move without you, or leave a lot of money on the table, you'll find these sessions invaluable.\nIn-depth Psychology\n\nIf you thought you understood trading psychology, think again. We delve into it from the most in-depth perspectives you've never heard about. Combining years of research and real-world experience, we take you on a journey to the depth of your mind to equip you with proven methods and powerful techniques. If you've felt that there's a mysterious wall between you and success, and that you've been holding yourself back as you keep repeating the same self-defeating patterns, you're going to find out how to finally overcome it. More than just trading psychology, we dive deep into insights and techniques ranging from the sports world to ancient spiritualities, and apply them in a unique and powerful way to trading to finally allow you to trade correctly with confidence. This part of the training alone can change your whole trading and your entire life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:640f628e0ed3e84b6d1d7a5351a60fe0f66e85f2","amp;dn":"OpenTrader+-+Professional+Training+Program","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"640f628e0ed3e84b6d1d7a5351a60fe0f66e85f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,15,98,142,14,211,232,75,109,29,122,83,81,166,15,224,246,110,133,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
