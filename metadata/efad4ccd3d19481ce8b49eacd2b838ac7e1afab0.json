He was the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter during the band's psychedelic years, providing major musical and stylistic direction in their early work: he is credited with creating their name. Barrett left the group in April 1968 amid speculations of mental illness exacerbated by drug use, and was briefly hospitalised.\nHe was active musically for ten years, recording with Pink Floyd four singles, the debut album (and contributing to the second one), plus several unreleased songs. In 1969, Barrett started off a solo career with the release of the single, &quot;Octopus&quot;, which foreshadowed his first solo album, The Madcap Laughs (1970), which was recorded over the course of one year (1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1969) with four different producers (Peter Jenner, Malcolm Jones, David Gilmour, and Roger Waters). Nearly two months after Madcap was released, Barrett began working on his second Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and last Ã¢â‚¬â€œ album, Barrett (produced by Gilmour, and featuring contributions from Richard Wright), which would be released in late 1970, before going into self-imposed seclusion lasting until his death in 2006. In 1988, an album of unreleased tracks/alternate takes, Opel, was released by EMI with Barrett's approval.\nBarrett's innovative guitar work and exploration of experimental techniques such as using dissonance, distortion, and feedback had an enormous legacy, with a wide variety of musicians from David Bowie to Brian Eno to Jimmy Page and more drawing influence. In his post-musician life, Barrett continued with his painting and dedicated himself to gardening, never to return to the public eye. He died in 2006. A number of biographies have been written about him since the 1980s, and Pink Floyd wrote and recorded several tributes to him after he left, most notably the 1975 album Wish You Were Here.\n\n\nSyd Barrett - The Madcap Laughs, Japan CD TOCP-53782:\nTracklist:\n1 Terrapin (5:04)\n2 No Good Trying (3:26)\n3 Love You (2:30)\n4 No Man's Land (3:03)\n5 Dark Globe (2:02)\n6 Here I Go (3:11)\n7 Octopus (3:47)\n8 Golden Hair (1:59)\n9 Long Gone (2:50)\n10 She Took A Long Cold Look (1:55)\n11 Feel (2:17)\n12 If It's In You (2:26)\n13 Late Night (3:11)\nBonus Tracks\n14 Octopus (Takes 1 &amp;2) (3:09)\n15 It's No Good Trying (Take 5) (6:22)\n16 Love You (Take 1) (2:28)\n17 Love You (Take 3) (2:11)\n18 She Took A Long Cold Look At Me (Take 4) (2:44)\n19 Golden Hair (Take 5) (2:28)\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Psychedelic folk, blues rock\nSource:CD \nFormat : FLAC (Lossless)\n\nAudio\n* * * MediaInspector for Mac - Version 2.0.1, build 900\n* * * Ã‚Â©2012 by Diego Massanti\n* * * MediaInfo Lib by Jerome Martinez\n* * * Raw File Report for Syd Barrett - The Madcap Laughs.ape\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : /Volumes/Flac/Syd Barrett [Syd Barrett &amp; The Madcap Laughts] [FLAC]/(1970) Syd Barrett - The Madcap Laughts (Japan) [FLAC]/Syd Barrett - The Madcap Laughs.ape\nFormat : Monkey's Audio\nFile size : 297 MiB\nDuration : 57mn 12s\nOverall bit rate : 726 Kbps\n\nAudio\nFormat : Monkey's Audio\nDuration : 57mn 12s\nBit rate : 726 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossless\nCompression ratio : 1.943\nStream size : 297 MiB (100%)\nEncoding settings : Normal\n\n\nSyd Barrett - Barrett:\nTracklist:\nSide One:\nA1 Baby Lemonade (04:10)\nA2 Love Song (03:03)\nA3 Dominoes (04:08)\nA4 It Is Obvious (02:59)\nA5 Rats (03:00)\nA6 Maisie (02:51)\nSide Two:\nB1 Gigolo Aunt (05:46)\nB2a Waving My Arms In The Air (02:09)\nB2b I Never Lied To You (01:50)\nB3 Wined And Dined (02:58)\nB4 Wolfpack (03:41)\nB5 Effervescing Elephant (01:52)\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Psychedelic folk, blues rock\nSource: Vynil \nFormat : FLAC (Lossless)\n\nAudio\n* * * MediaInspector for Mac - Version 2.0.1, build 900\n* * * Ã‚Â©2012 by Diego Massanti\n* * * MediaInfo Lib by Jerome Martinez\n* * * Raw File Report for 01.
