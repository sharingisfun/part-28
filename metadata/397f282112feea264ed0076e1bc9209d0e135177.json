Booker Ervin (1930-70), whose tenor cry was among the\n\nmost urgent sounds of the post-to-free-bop era, was, solely on the basis of that\n\nsound, more than equal to the task of jamming with Stitt. (not my words)\n\n\nThe common denominator of the (3) sessions revisited herein is Hammond player\n\nDon Patterson who has the unfortunate habit of &quot;pumping&quot; his right foot on the\n\nexpression/volume pedal.  This produces volume fluctuations of the organ sound\n\n(including all the Bass lines) which I find annoying.  Nonetheless, this album\n\nis worth your time to check out, if you enjoy saxophone &quot;battles.&quot; (my words)\n\n\n\nStitt was probably over-recorded (exploited with his permission) but these sets  \n\nare good IMO\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:397f282112feea264ed0076e1bc9209d0e135177","amp;dn":"SonnyStitt%2CBookerErvin%2CSOUL+PEOPLE%2C1964%2C66%2C69","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"397f282112feea264ed0076e1bc9209d0e135177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,127,40,33,18,254,234,38,78,208,7,110,27,201,32,157,14,19,81,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
