An overt dalliance with atonality, this recording \nabandons most conventional concepts of pitch, modes, and scales. With most of the 10 \ncompositions shifting gradually and without discernible focus, this is one of Eno's more varied ambient collections. Other than treated keyboard, conventional instrumentation is eschewed. The final recipe results in one ghostly, subdued soundscape after another. Brian Eno's minimalist leanings have rarely been in greater evidence than on this album.\n(Allmusic.com)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa398023cf2c1792158dba42221410aa22a37ea","amp;dn":"Brian+Eno+-+The+Shutov+Assembly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa398023cf2c1792158dba42221410aa22a37ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,163,152,2,60,242,193,121,33,88,219,164,34,33,65,10,162,42,55,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
