From the aptly titled opener by the flaming lips &quot;a change at christmas&quot; which paves the way nicely for the rest of the album suggesting there needs to be a change but also promising that there is hope for the future and that just maybe things will be alright. The sweet soulful sounds of classic artists such as Marvin Gaye, the O'Jays, The Staple Singers and James Brown rubbing shoulders with slightly more alternative artists such as A Girl Called Eddy, Neal Casal and The Handsome Family who plumb the depths of seasonal misery. Throw in a couple of traditional songs one of which is beautifully covered by McAlmont &amp; Arnold and the Other by Ed Harcourt, finish it all off with a couple of rocking upbeat entries from BB King and The Ventures which bring the festivities to a close nicely, lifting the holiday depression and leaving you feeling like maybe it wasn't so bad after all.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d6dd6a293e671cc767fa421b9d75e8e0f70f98","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Mojo%5C%27s+Blue+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d6dd6a293e671cc767fa421b9d75e8e0f70f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,214,221,106,41,62,103,28,199,103,250,66,27,157,117,232,224,247,15,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
