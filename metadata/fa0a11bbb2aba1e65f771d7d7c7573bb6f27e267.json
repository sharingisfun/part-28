I extracted the ISO along with a MDF file using DVD Decrypter, then compressed it using Winrar with 50mb library size on Best compression setting. The name of the rar file is Rogue_Galaxy_Complete_ISO...again, if you know how to set it up so you can create your own rar of the iso and seed this with me without the need to download it, it would be much appreciated.\n\nThis has not been tested beyond chapter 7 as of yet, but the file does load up using SM3.6 when burned onto a DVD9\n\n\n\nIndie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa0a11bbb2aba1e65f771d7d7c7573bb6f27e267","amp;dn":"%5BPS2%5DRogue_Galaxy_RETAIL_DVD9.RAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa0a11bbb2aba1e65f771d7d7c7573bb6f27e267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,10,17,187,178,171,161,230,95,119,29,125,124,117,115,187,111,39,226,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
