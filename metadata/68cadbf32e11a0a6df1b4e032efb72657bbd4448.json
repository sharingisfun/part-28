Although their music is rooted in traditional bluegrass and the pure harmonies of the first wave of country bands from the Carter Family to the Stanley Brothers, STILL FEELS GOOD ranges even further afield of those roots than their previous work. &quot;Bob That Head,&quot; a flirtation with country rap along the lines of Big and Rich, and the R&amp;B smoothness of &quot;She Goes All the Way&quot; (which features a guest vocal by actor and singer Jamie Foxx) are the most pop-oriented songs on the album. Elsewhere, &quot;Help Me Remember&quot; and &quot;No Reins&quot; work the power ballad angle of Bon Jovi&amp;#039;s country crossover LOST HIGHWAY, and &quot;Winner At A Losing Game&quot; and &quot;Secret Smile&quot; are the album&amp;#039;s most traditional country tunes.\n\nInformaciÃƒÂ³n Disco:\n?
