Adding to the intensity: Chess's boyfriend, Terrible, doesn't trust her, and Lex, the son of a rival crime lord, is trying to reignite the sparks between him and Chess.\n\nPlus there's the little matter of Chess's real job as a ghost hunter for the Church of Real Truth, investigating reports of a haunting at a school in the heart of Downside. Someone seems to be taking a crash course in summoning the dead - and if Chess doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch her back, she may soon be joining their ranks.\n\nAs Chess is drawn into a shadowy world of twisted secrets and dark violence, it soon becomes clear that she's not going to emerge from its depths without making the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n=======\n\nNOTE\n\nThere is an error running through these copies.\nThe chapter title is always one chapter ahead.\nChapter one is marked 'chapter two', etc.\nUntil chapter thirty-nine has no number, instead the end cover.\nThis does not effect the story, everything else is as it should be.\nI'll leave it as it is and offer it to you.\n\n=======\n\nAlternate :\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:25D3DAA322E79F78F20198BEAEA4896F70395352\n\n=======\n\nTo make upload requests visit here &gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=======\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d3daa322e79f78f20198beaea4896f70395352","amp;dn":"Sacrificial+Magic+-+Stacia+Kane+-+2012+%5Bepub.pdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d3daa322e79f78f20198beaea4896f70395352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,211,218,163,34,231,159,120,242,1,152,190,174,164,137,111,112,57,83,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
