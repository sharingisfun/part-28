Gone are the awful disproportional overdubs and gone is the muffled sound. All that remains is Elvis and his musicians having a ball in the studio, recording some great songs. The greatest surprise must be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Amazing GraceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (take 2). Yes, we know that it has been released before. So we urge you to listen to that version first and then listen to our Ã¢â‚¬Å“blues versionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, wanna bet you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe this is the same take? We are very proud we can present this version to you, but we feel itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame it hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been released decades ago! \n\nSo get ready for some big surprises and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoil it for yourself by listening on your computer. This CD should be played on a real sound system, as loud as your neighbors allow. \n\nWith covers! Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec606036142790579c06b2804c1ed80c1e430abd","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Unedited+masters+1971+-+Nashville+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec606036142790579c06b2804c1ed80c1e430abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,96,96,54,20,39,144,87,156,6,178,128,76,30,216,12,30,67,10,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
