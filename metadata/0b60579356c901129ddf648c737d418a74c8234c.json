Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b60579356c901129ddf648c737d418a74c8234c","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+23rd-30th+dec+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b60579356c901129ddf648c737d418a74c8234c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,96,87,147,86,201,1,18,157,223,100,140,115,125,65,138,116,200,35,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
