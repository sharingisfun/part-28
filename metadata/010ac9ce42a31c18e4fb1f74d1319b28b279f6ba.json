Featuring the twin vocal assault of Justin Bond of 'Kiki and Herb' as the victim and Martyn Jacques as her vile step mother, along with the horrible ugly sisters of Adrian Huge and Adrian Stout. This sordid story of domestic abuse, drug addition and revenge will be released to co-incide with the live perfromance at the QEH in London's South Bank Centre on December 18/19/20.\nMartyn writes...\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I used to go see pantomimes when I was a boy and enjoy them. Now, a lot of modern celebrities canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t act, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have talent. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all 20 times more famous than anyone who actually does have talent. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reflection of the crap society in which we live. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reaction against that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMore specifically, Sinderella tells the story of our fairytale favourite after she has fallen on hard times and resorted to turning tricks in return for smack. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I play her evil stepmother, who is also her pimp,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Jacques. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hopefully we are going to be able to generate quite a lot of hatred on stage between us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (tigerlillies.com)\n\nTrack list:\nCD 1\n1 Scubber\n2 Sinderella\n3 The Bird\n4 Blow Jobs\n5 I Am Sinderella\n6 By The Moon\n7 I Cried\n8 Evil\n9 Beats The Crap\n10 Motherfucker\n11 Brick In The Wall\n12 Ugly\n13 Bad\nCD 2\n14 Raindrops\n15 Fucked\n16 Lonely Girl\n17 Evil Twat\n18 Whore House\n19 Stepmother\n20 O Yea\n21 Tick Tock\n22 Life's A Cunt\n23 Grim Reaper\n24 Croak\n25 Pull The Trigger\n\nCredits:\nJustin Bond : Vocals\nMartyn Jaques :Lead Vocals, Accordion, Guitar, Ukulele, Piano\nAdrian Stout : Double Bass, Bass Guitar, Theremin, Musical Saw, Sleigh Bells, Backing Vocals\nAdrian Hughes :Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals\nALL SONGS and TEXT WRITTEN BY MARTYN JAQUES\nRecorded , Mixed and Mastered by Marco Paschke and Boris Wilsdorf at andereBaustelle Tonstudio Berlin.\nAdditional vocal recordings :\nSteve Kent, Tin Pan Alley Studio , London\n\nEnjoy and share!
