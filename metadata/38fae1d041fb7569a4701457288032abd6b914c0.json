When the soundtrack is played backwards, Beavis and Butthead are heard speaking clearly, including phrases such as &quot;Everybody go to college, study hard, study hard.&quot;\n\nGoofs:Factual errors: The airplane is pictured with a red light on the tip of its starboard wing.

Don&amp;#039;t stop until you reach the back of his teeth!\n\nFans of the television show will probably die laughing, but some others may enjoy it also. The film focuses on Beavis and Butt-Head as they go on a cross country road trip to recover their stolen television, but unknowingly fall deep into a plot involving the theft of a man-made biological weapon. The cast of voices are a real treat, especially Robert Stack as an ATF agent. Tune in if you&amp;#039;re in the mood for a few laughs.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;!!
