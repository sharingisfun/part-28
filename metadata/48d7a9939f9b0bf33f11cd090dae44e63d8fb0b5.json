It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this &quot;globalization.&quot; That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?\n\nCourse Syllabus\nLecture 1: What is World History?\nLecture 2: Peoples, Plagues and Plunders\nLecture 3: Warfare and Motion\nLecture 4: Conquests\nLecture 5: The Beginnings of Globalization in the Atlantic Worlds\nLecture 6: The Beginnings of Globalization in the Indian Ocean Worlds\nLecture 7: The Worlds that Merchants Made\nLecture 8: The Seventeenth-Century Crisis\nLecture 9: Empire and Enlightenment\nLecture 10: The Wealth of Nations\nLecture 11: The World in Revolution\nLecture 12: States and Nations\nLecture 13: Global Frontiers\nLecture 14: Empires and Nations\nLecture 15: Worlds in Motion\nLecture 16: The Peak of Eurocentrism\nLecture 17: Retreat of the Elephants\nLecture 18: The World in 1914\nLecture 19: Civilization and its Discontents\nLecture 20: Worlds at War\nLecture 21: Apex to Aftermath\nLecture 22: Three World Orders\nLecture 23: Our Globalization\nLecture 24: Back to the Future\n\nMore course info: https://www.coursera.org/course/wh1300\n\n\nType: mp4\nSize: 960x540 @ 29fps\nAudio bitrate: 126kpbs\nEnglish subtitles included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d7a9939f9b0bf33f11cd090dae44e63d8fb0b5","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+World+since+1300","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d7a9939f9b0bf33f11cd090dae44e63d8fb0b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,215,169,147,159,155,11,243,63,17,205,9,13,174,68,230,61,143,176,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
