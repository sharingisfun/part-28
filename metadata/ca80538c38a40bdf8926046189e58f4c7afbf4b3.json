Ian McDiarmid, one of the most notable talents about today, is in the title role. Kindly seed.\r\n\r\nAnd see if you agree with this response -\r\n\r\nâ€œKing Lear absolutely shone. Gaynor Macfarlaneâ€™s direction was immaculate. Every player spoke the verse so well that its rhythm amplified the dramatic impact. Ian McDiarmid played Lear, Bill Paterson was Gloucester, both performances outstanding, nuanced, gripping. When Goneril and Regan faced down their father, questioning his requirement for a regal entourage, McDiarmidâ€™s response â€œOh reason not the needâ€¦â€ had the fury of both a king and a father who no longer exerts power. The blinding of Gloucester was horrific in its unseen intensity. I started listening on the dot of 9pm and didnâ€™t miss a word until, two and a half hours later, it ended.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca80538c38a40bdf8926046189e58f4c7afbf4b3","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+28+-+King+Lear+-+bbc+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca80538c38a40bdf8926046189e58f4c7afbf4b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,128,83,140,56,164,11,223,137,38,4,97,137,229,143,76,122,251,244,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
