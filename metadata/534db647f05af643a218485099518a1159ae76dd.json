(The group's intriguing-yet-mismatched union with Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro yields only one track, &quot;My Friends.&quot;)\n\n The Chili Peppers are best known for their energetic punk-funk anthems but their mainstream breakthrough, the gently building ballad &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; opens GREATEST HITS. It's followed in short order, however by the boisterous, slaphappy &quot;Give It Away.&quot; Other Peppers high points include the beautifully melancholy &quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; the hard-to-find &quot;Soul to Squeeze,&quot; the folky &quot;Breaking the Girl,&quot; and the only pre-1990s track--the group's wonderfully rocked-out cover of Stevie Wonder's &quot;Higher Ground.&quot; Of course, this HITS collection includes the seemingly requisite (and quite good) two new tracks--the driving &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; and the dreamy &quot;Save the Population.&quot; GREATEST HITS effectively chronicles the Peppers' transition from goofy party boys to mature, highly inventive rock band.\n\n Greatest hits release for the rap-rock/funk-metal act features 16 tracks including 14 favorites &amp; 2 brand new tracks, 'Fortune Faded' &amp; 'Save The Population'.
