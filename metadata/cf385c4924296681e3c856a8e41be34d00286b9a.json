The novel is told through narratives alternating between two time periods, 1958 and 1985, which shift among the different perspectives of its protagonists. It deals with themes which would eventually become King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma, and ugliness lurking beneath a facade of traditional small-town values. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year. Publishers Weekly listed It as the best-selling book in America in 1986.\n\nTotal Duration: 45:15:47\nTotal MP3 Size: 1200.0 MB (1.2 GB)\nEncoded At: CBR 64 kbit/s 44100 Hz Mono\nRead By Steven Weber\n\n---------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n---------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf385c4924296681e3c856a8e41be34d00286b9a","amp;dn":"IT+-+Stephen+King+%5BNew+Audio+Release%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf385c4924296681e3c856a8e41be34d00286b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,56,92,73,36,41,102,129,227,200,86,168,228,27,227,77,0,40,107,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
