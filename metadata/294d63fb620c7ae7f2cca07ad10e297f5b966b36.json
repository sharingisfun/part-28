Introduced in the same issue were Paperinik's two new allies, the A.I. Uno (One), who resides in the skyscraper Ducklair Tower, and Lyla Lay, a journalist and robot utilized by a time police organization based in the 23rd century.\n\nThe series was extremely well received at the beginning of its run, and saluted as an unexpectedly innovative project for Disney.
