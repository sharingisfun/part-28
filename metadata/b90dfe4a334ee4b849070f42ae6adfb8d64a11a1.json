As one of the first hardcore albums, it was a galvanizing influence on the musical and attitudinal development of the genre, also helping to kickstart the fertile California scene. The record's tactics are not subtle in the least; Jello Biafra's odd warble and spat-out lyrics leave no doubt as to what he thinks, baiting his targets of conservatism, violence, overbearing authority, and capitalist greed with a viciously satirical sarcasm that keeps his unflinchingly political outlook from becoming too didactic. The thin production dilutes some of the music's power, but the ragged speed-blur still packs a wallop, and the hooks cribbed from surf and rockabilly give it a gonzo edge. The songwriting isn't consistent all the way through the album, but classics like 'Kill the Poor,' 'Let's Lynch the Landlord,' 'Chemical Warfare,' 'California ÃƒÅ“ber Alles,' and 'Holiday In Cambodia' helped define the hardcore genre and, thus, must be heard.\n\n\nThis edition includes a six track bonus CD with early classic singles. Excellent quality using EAC/LAME 3.95 VBR.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b90dfe4a334ee4b849070f42ae6adfb8d64a11a1","amp;dn":"Dead+Kennedys+-+Fresh+Fruit+For+Rotting+Vegetables+2CD+%28Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b90dfe4a334ee4b849070f42ae6adfb8d64a11a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,13,254,74,51,78,228,184,73,7,15,66,174,106,223,184,214,74,17,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
