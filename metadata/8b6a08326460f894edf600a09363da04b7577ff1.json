If the header says \\&quot;PILOT\\'S FS Global 2010 R1 for ...\\&quot; then you need\nSP1. DO NOT INSTALL SP1, IF YOU RUN A LATER VERSION!\nWHAT HAS BEEN FIXED?\n=====================\nDue to the nature of SRTM in flat areas high buildings can be mistaken for a hill. It is\nimpossible to solve this issue by reworking data using a special algorithm. We\ntherefore decided to switch data sources for North America. Instead of SRTM we will\nbe using alternative data in future versions. SP1 addresses obvious issues in the\narea of Florida.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6a08326460f894edf600a09363da04b7577ff1","amp;dn":"FSX+FSGLOBAL2010+SP1+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6a08326460f894edf600a09363da04b7577ff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,106,8,50,100,96,248,148,237,246,0,160,147,99,218,4,183,87,127,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
