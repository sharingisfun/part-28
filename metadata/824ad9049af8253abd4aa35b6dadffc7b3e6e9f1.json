Curley went on to work with Hank Williams and write one of his biggest hits, Half As Much, but here he proves convincingly that he's much more than a footnote to the Hank Williams story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824ad9049af8253abd4aa35b6dadffc7b3e6e9f1","amp;dn":"Curley+Williams+-+Half+As+Much+-+Bear+Family+CD+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824ad9049af8253abd4aa35b6dadffc7b3e6e9f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,74,217,4,154,248,37,58,189,74,163,91,109,173,255,199,179,230,233,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
