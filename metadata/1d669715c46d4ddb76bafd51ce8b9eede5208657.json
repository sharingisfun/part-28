This book helps to prevent such problems by showing how C programmers get themselves into trouble. Each of the book's many examples has trapped a professional programmer.\n\nIn addition to its examples, C Traps and Pitfalls offers advice on:\n\n* Avoiding off-by-one errors\n* Understanding and constructing function declarations\n* Understanding the subtle relationship between pointers andarrays\n\nDistilled from the author's experience over a decade ofprogramming in C, this book is an ideal resource for anyone,novice or expert, who has ever written a C program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat This Book Is?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC Traps And Pitfalls aims to encourage defensive programming by showing how other people, even experienced professionals, have gotten themselves into trouble. These mistakes are generally easy to avoid once seen and understood, so the emphasis is on specific examples rather than generalities.\n\nThis book belongs on your shelf if you are using C at all seriously, even if you are an expert: many of the professional C programmers who saw early drafts said things like &quot;that bug bit me just last week!&quot; If you are teaching a course that uses C, it belongs at the top of your supplementary reading list.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat This Book Is Not?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis book is not a criticism of C. Programmers can get themselves into trouble in any language. I have tried here to distill a decade of C experience into a compact form in the hope that you, the reader, will be able to avoid some of the stupid mistakes I've made and seen others make.\n\nThis book is not a cookbook. Errors cannot be avoided by recipe. If they could, we could eliminate automobile accidents by plastering the countryside with &quot;Drive Carefully&quot; signs! People learn most effectively through experience--their own or someone else's. Merely understanding how a particular kind of mistake is possible is a big step on the way to avoiding it in the future.\n\nThis book is not intended to teach you how to program in C (see Kernighan and Ritchie: The C Programming Language, Second Edition , Prentice-Hall 1988), nor is it a reference manual (see Harbison and Steele: C: A Reference Manual, Second Edition , Prentice-Hall, 1987). It does not mention algorithms or data structures (see Van Wyk: Data Structures And C Programs , Addison-Wesley 1988), and only briefly discusses portability (see Horton: How To Write Portable Programs In C. , Prentice-Hall 1989) and operating system interfaces (see Kernighan and Pike: The Unix Programming Environment , Prentice-Hall 1984). The problems mentioned are real, although often shortened (for a collection of composed C problems see Feuer: The C Puzzle Book , Prentice-Hall 1982). It is neither a dictionary nor an encyclopedia; I have kept it short to encourage you to read it all.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAndrew Koenig is a member of the Large-Scale Programming Research Department at AT&amp;T's Shannon Laboratory, and the Project Editor of the C++ standards committee. A programmer for more than 30 years, 15 of them in C++, he has published more than 150 articles about C++, and speaks on the topic worldwide.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
