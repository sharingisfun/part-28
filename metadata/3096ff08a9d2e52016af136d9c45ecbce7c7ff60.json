It was Metallica's first live album and was released in a box set format in 1993. It contained three CDs or Cassette tapes, with songs from concerts in Mexico City on the Nowhere Else to Roam tour, as well three VHS tapes, while a newer version contains two DVDs from concerts in San Diego on the Wherever We May Roam Tour and Seattle on the Damaged Justice Tour. It was originally released as a cardboard box depicting the style of a typical tour equipment transport box. Besides the audio and video media, the box featured additional bonus material (booklet showing a multitude of photos, typical tour correspondence as sent and received by the band and their management, and internal documents and handwritten notes; a recreated copy of an access pass to the &quot;Snakepit&quot; part of the tour stage; a cardboard drawing/airbrush stencil for the &quot;Scary Guy&quot; logo). Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge has been certified 15x platinum by the RIAA as a long-form video format.\n\nby WIKIPEDIA\n\nTRACKLIST:\nDisc 1:\n01 - Enter Sandman.wma                                                    \n02 - Creeping Death.wma                                                   \n03 - Harvester Of Sorrow.wma                                              \n04 - Welcome Home (Sanitarium).wma                                        \n05 - Sad But True.wma                                                     \n06 - Of Wolf And Man.wma                                                  \n07 - The Unforgiven.wma                                                   \n08 - Justice Medley.wma                                                   \n09 - Bass-Guitar Solos.wma\n\nDisc 2:\n01 - Through The Never.wma                                                \n02 - For Whom The Bell Tolls.wma                                          \n03 - Fade To Black.wma                                                    \n04 - Master Of Puppets.wma                                                \n05 - Seek &amp; Destroy.wma                                                   \n06 - Whiplash.wma \n\nDisc 3:\n01 - Nothing Else Matters.wma                                             \n02 - Wherever I May Roam.wma                                              \n03 - Am I Evil.wma                                                       \n04 - Last Caress.wma                                                      \n05 - One.wma                                                              \n06 - Battery.wma                                                          \n07 - The Four Horsemen.wma                                                \n08 - Motorbreath.wma                                                      \n09 - Stone Cold Crazy.wma\n\nThis torrent only contains the recorded audio at the Sports Palace, Mexico City, Mexico on February 25, 26, 27, and March 1 and 2, 1993.\n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3096ff08a9d2e52016af136d9c45ecbce7c7ff60","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Live+Shit+-+Binge+And+Purge+%281993%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3096ff08a9d2e52016af136d9c45ecbce7c7ff60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,150,255,8,169,210,229,32,22,175,19,109,156,69,236,188,231,199,255,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
