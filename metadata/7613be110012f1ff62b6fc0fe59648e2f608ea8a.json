On stage Craig Grant and Chris Gordon play dual frontman roles, supported, like a see-saw on an axis, by Dave McClean. In the studio each member is autonomous, lyrics, beats, melodies and ideas come from everywhere.\n\nThe music they make is steely hard, yet cut through with raw, emotive longing and power. Their guitars are loud, but they have no room or need for a drummer. &amp;#039;Evil Has Never&amp;#039; is an oily black lament to a love that just can&amp;#039;t work. &amp;#039;Opposite Direction&amp;#039; channels the power of prime My Bloody Valentine, &amp;#039;Taste Of Harmony&amp;#039; steers melody through starkly sculpted electro.\n\nOfficial HP: www.unionofknives.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7613be110012f1ff62b6fc0fe59648e2f608ea8a","amp;dn":"union+of+knives+-+violence+and+birdsong+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7613be110012f1ff62b6fc0fe59648e2f608ea8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,19,190,17,0,18,241,255,98,182,252,15,229,150,72,226,246,8,234,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
