Dapper, witty, and in their early forties (with nearly 60 years of combined experience between them), they symbolize the union of amateur enthusiasm and acute professionalism that has made their television program a cultural phenomenon. Now, in this fascinating collection of tales of their personal adventures hunting -- and discovering -- priceless &quot;junk&quot; (including some notable Roadshow success stories), readers will learn how to see the extraordinary in the mundane. &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; is part history lesson and part treasure map for finding valuable antiques where they would be least expected.\n\n\nBy Leigh Keno, Leslie Keno\nPublished by Grand Central Publishing in 2008\nEPUB, Retail, 304 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac863dee184fd8bd1015439f6d1e8b2752b3e545","amp;dn":"%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac863dee184fd8bd1015439f6d1e8b2752b3e545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,134,61,238,24,79,216,189,16,21,67,159,109,30,139,39,82,179,229,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
