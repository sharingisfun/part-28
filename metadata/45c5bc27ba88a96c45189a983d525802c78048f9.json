Her style is eclectic but heavily drawn (in places) from Nirvana era grunge, alt.country but with none of the formulaic twang, and sensitive confessionals of introspection. \n\nListen for instance to the tracks 'Deathbed', Comfortable in Hell and God Killed My Love. These are about as good as any other contempory singer songwriter out there-which is to say-excellent. \n\nBasket Full of Puppies is an EP recorded mostly live from a soundboard at a live performance. So the production is minimal and captures very well the feeling of her performing live in your room, especially on the solo voice and guitar tracks. \n\nNone More Icey starts off with a scalding satire of bad rap music done by even worse white guys. Its more funny than compulsive listening, and the EP gets better very quickly. \n\nSad Songs Kill Themselves has studio versions of some of the live EP material. On here Deathbed is accompanied by bowed cello and violin, reminiscent of Nirvana's Unplugged, keeping its somber tones intact while adding interest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c5bc27ba88a96c45189a983d525802c78048f9","amp;dn":"Leticia+Wolf-album+collection%3B+alt.folk%2C+alt.grunge%2C+alt.country","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c5bc27ba88a96c45189a983d525802c78048f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,197,188,39,186,136,169,108,69,24,154,152,61,82,88,2,199,128,72,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
