He would have known the Mass texts more or less inside out, which explains why his readings focus not on the sung parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which, for the most part, present the text in a relatively four-square fashion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but on the orchestral writing which, given the gloriously full-bodied playing of the Bavarian orchestra, so lusciously illuminates familiar words. He approaches the Masses with many of the same ideas he so eloquently propounds in his recordings of the symphonies and the music unfolds with a measured, almost relaxed pace which creates a sense of vast spaciousness. This can have its drawbacks: you can be so entranced by the beautifully moulded orchestral introduction to the Benedictus from the D minor Mass that the entry of a rather full-throated Marga Schiml comes as a rude interruption. DG's transfers are extraordinarily good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they really seem to have produced a sound which combines the warmth of the original LP with the clarity of detail we expect from CD.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Gramophone Classical Music Guide, 2010\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12030e41d231aba522e54a94bbcc0f1771ee231c","amp;dn":"Bruckner+-+Masses+%28Jochum%29+-+2CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12030e41d231aba522e54a94bbcc0f1771ee231c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,3,14,65,210,49,171,165,34,229,74,148,187,204,15,23,113,238,35,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
