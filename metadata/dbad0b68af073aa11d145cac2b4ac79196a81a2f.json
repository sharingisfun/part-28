The B.1 was unable to fulfil this role due to Soviet advances in technology, so the more powerful B.2 was introduced in 1962. However, by 1964 it still had to be consigned to the low-level and K.1 and later K.2 tanker roles. The Victor soldiered on as a tanker into the &amp;#039;90s, when it was used in the Gulf War.\n\n*FS2004 only*\n\nFeatures -\n\n- 4 model variations included :\nVictor K.2 in &amp;#039;hemp&amp;#039; (XL231)\nVictor K.2 in camo over white (XL512)\nVictor K.1A in camo over white (XH616)\nVictor B.1A in all-white (XH621)\n\n- Specular Reflectivity (&amp;#039;dynamic shine&amp;#039;)\n- Authentic animated undercarriage and airbrakes\n- Animated crew entry hatch\n- Extend/retract wing root APU (on Concorde visor function) (K.2&amp;#039;s only)\n- Extend/retract rear fuselage Ram Air Intakes (on Concorde visor function) (K.2&amp;#039;s only)\n- Animated, working landing lights (on tailhook function)\n- &amp;#039;Tanking Lights&amp;#039; (8) on strobe lights key (O-key to toggle)\n- Very detailed &amp;#039;virtual cockpit&amp;#039; with animated throttles, pedals and control columns\n- Photo-real texturing in virtual cockpit and on 2D panel\n- Detailed copilot figure\n- Virtual panel with hi-resolution virtual gauges\n- Fine-tuned flight characteristics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbad0b68af073aa11d145cac2b4ac79196a81a2f","amp;dn":"FS2004+ALPHASIM+Handley-Page+Victor.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbad0b68af073aa11d145cac2b4ac79196a81a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,173,11,104,175,7,58,161,29,20,92,172,43,74,199,145,150,168,26,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
