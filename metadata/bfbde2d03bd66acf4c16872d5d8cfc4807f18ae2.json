Big business, aided by bad government, has spoilt the party for everyone, yet it is individuals and small companies that are really paying the price.\n\nWith the depressed state of the economy, companies are not giving much in the way of increases, vacant positions are not being filled, and contracts are not being awarded or renewed. Employees and contractors have to work harder for the same, or even less, money. How can individuals, entrepreneurs, small business owners and even civil servants and homemakers make the best of a bad situation? \n\nArmed with the same expert level of dealmaking skills as the captains of industry, you, too, can substantially improve your personal wealth and financial future. This is dealonomics.\n\nFun to read, easily accessible and with loads of practical examples, this book will equip you with the world-class dealmaking expertise you need to get the income you want. An essential read for everyone who wants to improve their income or financial position in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recession-prone world.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction , Business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfbde2d03bd66acf4c16872d5d8cfc4807f18ae2","amp;dn":"Dealonomics+by+Kim+Meredith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfbde2d03bd66acf4c16872d5d8cfc4807f18ae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,189,226,208,59,214,106,207,76,22,135,45,93,140,252,72,7,241,138,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
