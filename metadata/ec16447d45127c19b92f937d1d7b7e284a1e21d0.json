Conceptually, this series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case, professional figure skaters are paired with well-known hockey players.\n\nIf you are a fan of figure skating, ice hockey or Dancing With The Stars, this show is worth a try.\n\nThis episode looks back at the unlikely creation of this show and highlights the personalities and performances of skaters from the first three seasons. The content is surprisingly emotional; I was in tears a few times. \n\nThe 16 skaters for season 4 are each briefly introduced. This season, the pairs of figure skaters, hockey players will be: \n\n- Oksana Kazakova, Vladimir Malakhov\n- Marie-France Dubreuil, Mathieu Dandenault\n- Jessica Dube, Brian Savage\n- Sinead Kerr, Grant Marshall\n- Mike Krushelnyski, Marcy Hinzmann\n- Amanda Evora, Scott Thornton\n- Violetta Afanasieva, Jason Strudwick\n- Shae-Lynn Bourne, Anson Carter\n\nThis episode aired on CBC HD on Sep 22, 2013. The file is substantially larger than normal to achieve reasonable video quality. The quality is something like A8 V8 since it was encoded from an analog source.  \n\nCBC has a big website for this show at http://www.cbc.ca/battle/\n\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Battle.of.the.Blades.S04E00.Made.in.Canada.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            1,363,222,528 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             1:28:15\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            29.970 fps\nBitrate:              1923 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              128 kbps\nBitrate Type:         CBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec16447d45127c19b92f937d1d7b7e284a1e21d0","amp;dn":"Battle+of+the+Blades+S04E00+Made+in+Canada+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec16447d45127c19b92f937d1d7b7e284a1e21d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,22,68,125,69,18,124,25,185,47,147,125,29,123,126,40,74,30,33,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
