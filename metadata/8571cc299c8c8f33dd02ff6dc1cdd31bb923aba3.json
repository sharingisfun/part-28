Overall, it's a decent derivation of post -- grunge and a healthy sampling of rising trip -- hop and ambient electronica during the mid --'90s, so perhaps it's all right for the album itself to experience floppy production. Lead singer Liesje Sadonius is sultry while defining Hooverphonic's signature shoegazer -- like vocalics, with almost impressive electronic support from guitarists Alex Callier and Raymond Geerts and keyboardist Frank DuchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªne. Debut single &quot;2 Wicky&quot; struts with a mysterious bass drop, and it's Sadonius' sexy vocal charm that fully ties it all together. Other tracks such as &quot;Inhaler&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; are moody but danceable, whereas &quot;Nr. 9&quot; blasts with hazy My Bloody Valentine -- like distortion. The orchestration is tangled, but the artistic purpose of such musical beauty defines Hooverphonic's initial concept. A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular depicts a glossy confidence, but not sheer enough for a fully enigmatic sound. But that's perfectly fine -- Hooverphonic characterizes its own grace with experimental soundscapes of melodic disarray, but just barely. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8571cc299c8c8f33dd02ff6dc1cdd31bb923aba3","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Hooverphonic+-+A+New+Stereophonic+Sound+Spectacular","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8571cc299c8c8f33dd02ff6dc1cdd31bb923aba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,113,204,41,156,140,143,51,221,2,255,109,193,205,211,27,185,35,171,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
