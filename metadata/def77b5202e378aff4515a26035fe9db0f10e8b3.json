They help children build skills like hand-eye coordination, problem solving, and simply learning how to be a good team player and work well with others. But most of all, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re lots of fun. This collection of timeless games guarantees kids a great timeÃ¢â‚¬â€by themselves, with a group of friends, or with their family. And best of all, no batteries are required . . . and very little equipment, too.\n\n ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hopscotch and Dodgeball, Four Square and Stoopball, Horse and One Old Cat (a ball game similar to baseball, but with only one base). All you need is your brainÃ¢â‚¬â€and occasionally a paper and penÃ¢â‚¬â€to play games like Association, the MinisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cat, and Dumb Crambo (which is similar to Charades, but has a rhyming twist). A rainy day with no pals around would be just right to make Hand Shadows, walk on Can Stilts, or practice Jacks. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget card games like Crazy Eights and Rummy, Crab and Sack Races, and old favorites like Duck, Duck, Goose and Red Rover. And because no parent likes to hear the whine of &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole chapter of games for the car!\n\n Black-and-white illustrations keep the old-timey feel while getting kids excited to play. Simple instructions explain how many people can play, what you need, the object of the game, and the basic rules. For extra entertainment, there are also lots of fun facts about the history of the games sprinkled throughout. This book is so packed with activities that kids will want to turn off their computers, shut down their PlayStations and Xboxes, and get playing the old-fashioned way!\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:def77b5202e378aff4515a26035fe9db0f10e8b3","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Stone+Skipping+and+Other+Fun+Old-Time+Games%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"def77b5202e378aff4515a26035fe9db0f10e8b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,247,123,82,2,227,120,175,244,81,90,38,3,95,233,219,15,16,232,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
