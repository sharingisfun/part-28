There are certainly songs that I haven't missed, and some others which are great but couldn't fit for a reason or another (for instance, Ducktails hardly fits here, although Beach Point Pleasant is a great song that I definitely recommend if you can get past its experimental appeareance).\nChillwave is a &quot;genre&quot; coined in 2009. It is defined as low fidelity electronic music harking back at '80s synth-pop and dream pop. However, many of the artists are so different between them that the genre is hardly valid, but one thing is for sure: at least some of these artists won't go away too fast. But even some of the rather mimetic bedroom artists that surfaced in the last 2 years have some songs great for chilling out in the summer.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1.
