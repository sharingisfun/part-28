There is a statue in his memory in Dampier, which is one of the towns to which he often returned.\n\nRed Dog is believed to have been born in the town of Paraburdoo in 1971 and had a variety of names to those who knew him, including: Bluey, Tally Ho, and Dog of the Northwest.\n\nSoon after Red's death in 1979, Australian author Nancy Gillespie wrote and compiled anecdotes and poetry written by several people of the Pilbara region for her book Red Dog as did Beverly Duckett in her 1993 book Red Dog: The Pilbara Wanderer.\n\nRed Dog's story and statue have caught the attention of a number of people passing through Dampier including British author Louis de BerniÃƒÂ¨res, who was inspired to write a book loosely based on Red's legend called Red Dog. A four-wheel-drive club has been named in his honor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:428d34dd6de37ba005ad523ac7874196161f2fb4","amp;dn":"Red.Dog.2011.BluRay.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"428d34dd6de37ba005ad523ac7874196161f2fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,141,52,221,109,227,123,160,5,173,82,58,199,135,65,150,22,31,47,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
