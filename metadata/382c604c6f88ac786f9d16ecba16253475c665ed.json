Tadeo (CRC, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9780849375521\r\n\r\nDeveloping safety regulations for pesticides used around the worldâ€”in excess of 2.5 million tons annuallyâ€”requires reliable analytical methods for assessing their impact in food and in the environment. Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples presents the most effective techniques for analyzing pesticide residues and other chemical contaminants in foods as well as in soil, water, and air.\r\nRenowned Scientists Report New Data and Advances in the Field\r\n\r\nThe book introduces sample preparation, extraction, and analytical methods specific to each sample type, including foods from vegetal and animal origin. Other chapters discuss important aspects of quality assurance and the applicability of hyphenated analytical techniques. In addition to a practical chapter on the use of biosensors and immunoassays for monitoring and gathering exposure data, the book addresses regulatory aspects and presents current data on the levels of pesticides found in food and environmental matrices.\r\n\r\nLatest Methods Help Scientists Develop Safer, More Effective Pesticides\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples enables scientists to measure and predict the behavior and toxicity of pesticides with a higher degree of accuracy. The methodologies and insight in this timely work will contribute to the development of more effective, less toxic pesticides as well as better safety regulations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382c604c6f88ac786f9d16ecba16253475c665ed","amp;dn":"Analysis+of+Pesticides+in+Food+and+Environmental+Samples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382c604c6f88ac786f9d16ecba16253475c665ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,44,96,76,111,136,172,120,111,157,22,236,186,22,37,52,117,198,101,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
