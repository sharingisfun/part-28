Bloodshot began writing to hip hop in 1996 . He grew up listening to mostly East Coast style rap ( Wu-Tang , Gravediggaz , Cocoa Brovaz , Heltah Skeltah ). Another style he listened to was ( Memphis Rap ) , which consisted of nothing but gang related lyrics , mob based crews and southern influence. ( Prophet Posse , Hypnotize Mindz ). Around 2000 , Bloodshot decided to start doing Horrorcore music Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\n After 9+ pressed released cdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and over 15+ misc. releases , Bloodshot remains a heavy hitter in the genre.
