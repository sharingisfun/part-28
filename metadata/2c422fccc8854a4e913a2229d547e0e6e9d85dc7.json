But sooner or later\r\n\r\na commercial enterprise will commit itself to sending humans to Mars.\r\n\r\nHow will the astronauts survive? Some things to consider are:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Who decides what medical resources are used for whom?\r\n\r\nWho decides what medical resources are used for whom?\r\nâ€¢ What is the relative weight of mission success and the health of the\r\n\r\ncrew?\r\n\r\nWhat is the relative weight of mission success and the health of the\r\ncrew?\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Do we allow crewmembers to sacrifi ce their lives for the good of the\r\nmission?\r\n\r\nDo we allow crewmembers to sacrifi ce their lives for the good of the\r\nmission?\r\n\r\nâ€¢ And what if a crewmember does perish? Do we store the body for\r\n\r\nreturn to Earth or give the member a burial in space?\r\n\r\nQuestions like these, and hundreds of others, have been explored by\r\n\r\nscience fi ction, but scant attention has been paid by those designing\r\n\r\nmissions. Fortunately, the experience gained in polar exploration more\r\n\r\nthan 100 years ago provides crews and mission planners with a framework\r\n\r\nto deal with contingencies and it is this that forms the core of this book.\r\n\r\nWhy the parallels between polar and space exploration? Because polar\r\n\r\nexploration offers a better analogy for a Mars mission today than those\r\n\r\ninvoked by the space community. Although astronauts are routinely\r\n\r\ncompared to Lewis and Clark, Mars-bound astronauts will be closer in their\r\n\r\nroles to polar explorers. And, as much as space has been described as a\r\n\r\nNew Frontier, Mars bears greater similarity to the polar regions, which is\r\n\r\nwhy so much can be learned from those who ventured there.\r\n\r\nAnd what if a crewmember does perish?
