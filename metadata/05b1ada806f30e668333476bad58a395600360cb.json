A similar blend has occurred in the music world. Young artists from the Americas and beyond have used a stock of Latin rhythms, portions of alternative rock, reggae and electronica, spiced with local languages, rhythms and instruments to create a flavorful musical stew. \nIn this new Latin music, hints of Cuban son, Brazilian bossa nova, Argentinean tango, Colombian cumbia can be heard alongside touches of contemporary blues, loungy surf music, ragamuffin, trip-hop and hip-hop.The mÃƒÂ©lange reflects the multicultural influences guiding a new generation of musicians. \nNuevo Latino features the Cuban soul of singer and songwriter Raul Paz, Mexican musical and cultural revolutionaries Los de Abajo and newcomer Federico Aubele, who presents subtle remixes of tango from his native Argentina. The Eric Clapton-inspired guitar of Spanish superstar Jarabe De Palo reveals the deep influence of blues on his music. \nNew York band Mosquitos offers a beguiling blend of accessible rock and bossa nova.The multicultural background of London-based Kad Achouri is reflected in his intriguing music. French/Spanish singer Sergent Garcia?s mix of Cuban salsa, Jamaican reggae and ragamuffin have earned him worldwide fame. \nNuevo Latino also features Acida, an Argentinean husband and wife duo that perform loungy Latin music. Spanish singersongwriter Javier Ãƒï¿½lvarez, who was discovered singing in Madrid?s subways, is featured as our Colombian alternative rockers Aterciopelados.
