Only two issues were made before the title changed it's name to Astonishing. Fun curious from the past and extremely hilarious to read now - they are so dated and especially wrong in terms of science, but hey, it was the 50's, and we hadn't even reached the moon yet much less concretely defined the surface of Uranus. If you liked my other Marvel Boy torrent, this might be worth checking out to see where it all started. Please seed, enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa8f6369f063c89522d0d44cc5f3ae2016bcba6","amp;dn":"Marvel+Boy+01-02+%281950%2C+Atlas+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa8f6369f063c89522d0d44cc5f3ae2016bcba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,168,246,54,159,6,60,137,82,45,13,68,204,95,58,226,1,107,203,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
