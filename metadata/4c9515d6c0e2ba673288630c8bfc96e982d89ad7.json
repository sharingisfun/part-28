Each issue featured a single self contained story, though the book did have broad character arcs and subplots which developed throughout the series. The title kept to a strong continuity, with the events in each issue taking place between specific stories from the first two years of The Amazing Spider-Man from the early 1960s.\n\nThe series was primarily written by Kurt Busiek and penciled by Pat Olliffe, though Roger Stern, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz also contributed.\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9515d6c0e2ba673288630c8bfc96e982d89ad7","amp;dn":"Untold+Tales+of+Spider-Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9515d6c0e2ba673288630c8bfc96e982d89ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,149,21,214,192,226,186,103,50,136,99,12,139,252,150,233,130,216,154,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
