The band has experienced several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with their debut album Three Imaginary Boys; this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music was a staple of the emerging gothic rock genre.\r\n\r\nAfter the release of 1982's Pornography, the band's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the single &quot;Let's Go to Bed&quot; released the same year, Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band's music and their popularity increased as the decade wore on, with songs like &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;, &quot;Lovesong&quot; and &quot;Friday I'm in Love&quot;. The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004 and have released thirteen studio albums, ten EPs and over thirty singles during their career.\r\n\r\n1. Lullaby (ext remix) 7:41\r\n2.
