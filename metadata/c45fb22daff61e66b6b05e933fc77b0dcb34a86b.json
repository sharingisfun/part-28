The action scenes also are less dramatic than the Clone Wars graphic novel series. But it&amp;#039;s a coup that this adaptation includes a late Yoda scene that was not in the film but is already rumored to be an extra on the inevitable DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45fb22daff61e66b6b05e933fc77b0dcb34a86b","amp;dn":"STAR+WARS+EP+III+-+Revenge+Of+The+Sith+Graphic+Novel.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45fb22daff61e66b6b05e933fc77b0dcb34a86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,95,178,45,175,246,30,102,182,176,94,147,63,199,123,13,203,52,168,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
