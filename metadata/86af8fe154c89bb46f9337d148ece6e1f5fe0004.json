This argument has a long history, beginning with Francis BaconÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s claim that through science, humanity could make Nature bend to its will. This timely book unearths the challenge voiced by John Donne, Andrew Marvell, and the Earl of Rochester to BaconÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endeavor to make Nature subservient.\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\n&quot;A fascinating, well-argued comparison between Francis Bacon's narrative of recovering human dominion over nature and seventeenth-century skeptics who deny its possibility. Funari draws insightful parallels with today's proponents of technological solutions and environmental philosophers who propose new ways of living with the more-than-human world. Of interest to anyone who wishes to see how history and literature can inform the roots of today's environmental crisis.&quot;--Carolyn Merchant, professor, University of California, Berkeley and author of The Death of Nature and Reinventing Eden\n\n&quot;An original and interesting approach to the clash of cultures--the established literary world reacting against the rise of the scientific worldview--this book raises intriguing questions for anyone studying early modern thought.&quot;--Linda Anderson, professor of English, Virginia Tech, and author of A Place in the Story: Servants and Service in Shakespeare's Plays\n\n&quot;Francis Bacon and the Seventeenth-Century Intellectual Discourse provides new insight on the Baconian debates by examining the works of Donne, Marvell, and Rochester as resistance to Bacon's theory of scientific progression. With sharp, close readings, Funari persuasively demonstrates the argumentative power of seventeenth-century poetry as a counter narrative to what would become the dominant ideology of Western science.&quot;-- Amy L. Tigner, assistant professor of English, University of Texas, Arlington\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nANTHONY FUNARI Assistant Professor at Johnson County Community College, USA.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86af8fe154c89bb46f9337d148ece6e1f5fe0004","amp;dn":"Anthony+J.+Funari+-+Francis+Bacon+and+the+Seventeenth-Century+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86af8fe154c89bb46f9337d148ece6e1f5fe0004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,175,143,225,84,200,155,180,111,147,55,209,72,236,230,225,245,254,0,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
