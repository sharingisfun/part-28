And some of them were 2 page semi-diagonal scans?\n\nNo. I decided to start a project to give new life to these awesome books, keeping  the original format (paragraph range on top , paragraph and quote on the images).\n\nI took a semi-good OCR, gave a text review, re-added the italics, caps, images...\n\nWell, you get the idea.\n\nI know it's not ideal or perfect, but at least, it's a starting point. If you want to, you can change, add css to make the html bearable... I simply have no patience for making Css.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79a8d7a6edab6794bc939e5b76d877346e302d7","amp;dn":"The+citadel+of+chaos+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79a8d7a6edab6794bc939e5b76d877346e302d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,154,141,122,110,218,182,121,75,201,57,229,183,109,135,115,70,227,2,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
