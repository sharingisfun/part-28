The RIDD Quartet further consists of Jeff Davis on drums, Jon\nIrabagon on sax and Reuben Radding on bass. This album is not unlike &quot;Rye\nEclipse&quot;, although it is more transparent, more accessible, less urgent in its\nneed to tell the story as its predecessor. Many of the compositions have the\nsame abstract and emotional quality of her other recent album. But this is of\ncourse a quartet album, not Kris Davis and band. Jon Irabagon I find a\nrevelation on this album. To be honest, I thought his &quot;Outright&quot; album, released\nearlier this year, was a little over-ambitious, yet here his tone, free lyricism\nand emotional drive are excellent, not of the same level of Malaby, though, but\nreally strong. Radding is as good as we know him and so is Jeff Davis, and both\ncomplement each other well. The second track, &quot;Sky Circles&quot;, starts out quite\nslowly and gentle, yet it gradually starts building intensity and\nmomentum. Whether it's slow emotional explorations as on the title track (which\ndoes not sound like an avalanche at all, by the way), or a more intense and raw\napproach as on the beginning &quot;The Eye And The Telescope&quot;, the four musicians\nmanage to have a quite unique coherent and creative angle, with introspective\nand expansive moods alternating, exploring sound interactions and rhythmic\ninvention. The stylistical elements used are subtle : repetitive piano string\npluckings, or repetitive sax phrases, come and go, as do melodies and themes,\nand so does the volume, and the instruments, but all very subtly, creating\nslight differences and changes, nothing abrupt, yet full of little surprises\nthat make this quite a great listen. I like it a lot!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f8e3bb9fd9d6836975d8132343590261ff8884","amp;dn":"RIDD+Quartet+-+Fiction+Avalanche+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f8e3bb9fd9d6836975d8132343590261ff8884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,248,227,187,159,217,214,131,105,117,216,19,35,67,89,2,97,255,136,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
