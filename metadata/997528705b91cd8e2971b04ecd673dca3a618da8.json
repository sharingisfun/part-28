They become involved with Mexican rebels and from that point on, we get an engaging story as the outlaws party with the Mexican army, their hookers, and their alcohol - all of this leading up to the notorious ending where the Wild Bunch man their guns and duke-it-out with their enemies. &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; has obtained a notorious reputation for being one of the most violent movies ever made and is credited for being the movie that changed the way we looked at the &quot;old&quot; West and action cinema in general. Sam Peckinpah was a true revolutionary.
