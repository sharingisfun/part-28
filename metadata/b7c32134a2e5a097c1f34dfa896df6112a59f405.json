It will offend most anyone, so proceed with caution or not at all.\n\nAnd be forewarned: This is not a zombie book. This is a different sort of tale. It is a story about the unfortunate, about those who did not get away. It is a human story at its rotten heart. It is the reason we can't stop obsessing about these creatures, in whom we see all too much of ourselves.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15773951-i-zombie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15773951-i-zombie&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c32134a2e5a097c1f34dfa896df6112a59f405","amp;dn":"I%2C+Zombie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7c32134a2e5a097c1f34dfa896df6112a59f405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,195,33,52,162,229,160,151,193,243,77,250,137,109,246,17,42,89,244,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
