But the journey that led him there was neither inevitable nor smooth. This authoritative biography focuses on the evolution of Napoleon as a leader and debunks many of the myths that are often repeated about himÃ¢â‚¬â€sensational myths often propagated by Napoleon himself. Here, Philip Dwyer sheds new light on NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€especially his darker side and his passionsÃ¢â‚¬â€to reveal a ruthless, manipulative, driven man whose character has been disguised by the public image he carefully fashioned to suit the purposes of his ambition.\n\n Dwyer focuses acutely on NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formative years, from his Corsican origins to his French education, from his melancholy youth to his flirtation with radicals of the French Revolution, from his first military campaigns in Italy and Egypt to the political-military coup that brought him to power in 1799. One of the first truly modern politicians, Napoleon was a master of Ã¢â‚¬Å“spin,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ using the media to project an idealized image of himself. DwyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biography of the young Napoleon provides a fascinating new perspective on one of the great figures of modern history.\n\n\nCitizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power 2013 epub 799 pp\n\n\n In this second volume of Philip DwyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authoritative biography on one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most enthralling leaders, Napoleon, now 30, takes his position as head of the French state after the 1799 coup. Dwyer explores the young leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign, complete with mistakes, wrong turns, and pitfalls, and reveals the great lengths to which Napoleon goes in the effort to fashion his image as legitimate and patriarchal ruler of the new nation. Concealing his defeats, exaggerating his victories, never hesitating to blame others for his own failings, Napoleon is ruthless in his ambition for power. Following Napoleon from Paris to his successful campaigns in Italy and Austria, to the disastrous invasion of Russia, and finally to the war against the Sixth Coalition that would end his reign in Europe, the book looks not only at these events but at the character of the man behind them. Dwyer reveals NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darker sidesÃ‚â€”his brooding obsessions and propensity for violenceÃ‚â€”as well as his passionate nature: his loves, his ability to inspire, and his capacity for realizing his visionary ideas. In an insightful analysis of Napoleon as one of the first truly modern politicians, the author discusses how the persuasive and forward-thinking leader skillfully fashioned the image of himself that persists in legends that surround him to this day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8fdc1b729e1fd93128943110bdec18d8802c4aa","amp;dn":"Napoleon%3A+The+Path+to+Power+and+Citizen+Emperor+2+vols.+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8fdc1b729e1fd93128943110bdec18d8802c4aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,253,193,183,41,225,253,147,18,137,67,17,11,222,193,141,136,2,196,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
