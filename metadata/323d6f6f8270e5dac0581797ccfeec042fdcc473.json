Derrick - best known for his 1987 dance anthem Strings of Life under the name Rhythim Is Rhythim - has been an iconic name on the techno scene for over twenty years, DJing worldwide to a devoted fan base. Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, May's work - alongside fellow DJs Juan Atkins and Inner City's Kevin Saunderson - has provided the catalyst for a number of producers worldwide. In his latest 6 Music show Derrick plays a selection of tunes which have influenced and inspired him including tracks by Brian Eno, Peven Everett and Model 500. There's also a brand new 'Mayday' club mix featuring hot new material from his label - Transmat Recordings - and a selection of tracks of Derrick's favourite album of 2010 so far; Gil Scott Heron's 'I'm New Here.'.\n\n\n\nMUSIC AND FEATURED ITEMS\n1.\tGil Scott-Heron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Where Did the Night Go\n2.\tLuke Hess ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Way\n3.\tEno, Moebius &amp; Roedelius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Foreign Affairs\n4.\tCybotron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alley Of Your Mind\n5.\tModel 500 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nightdrive\n6.\tGil Scott-Heron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Crutch\n7.\tSeun Kuti ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fire Dance\n8.\tOrlando Voorn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Power Of Beauty\n9.\tKenny Larkin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Unknown\n10.\tAcoustic High End Research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Acid Child\n11.\tAnthony Shakir ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Arise\n12.\tMatthias Meyer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Infinity\n13.\tKapuchon and Benny Rodrigues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Reel\n14.\tCesar Merveille ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Chocopop Jazz\n15.\tIbex ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 360 (Dub mix)\n16.\tGlenn Underground ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Afro\n17.\tGummiHz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ One Groove &amp; Synth\n18.\tKarizma ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Ganni\n19.\tRobert Bosco ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Club\n20.\tBen Klock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Viscoplastic\n21.\tDVS1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Searching\n22.\tKarizma Feat.Taylor McFerrin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Georgia\n23.\tJoakim Lone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Meeting Blue Ice\n24.\tOrlando B ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Melancholy\n25.\tJona ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Secret\n26.\tAutotune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dirty\n27.\tGil Scott-Heron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Your Soul &amp; Mine\n28.\t[unknown] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sexy &amp; Strange\n29.\tTr ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Naive Track\n30.\tViscoplastic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Unknown\n31.\t[unknown] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ White Label\n32.\tPeven Everett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I Can't Believe I Loved Her\n33.\tSalvatone Eneda ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bruschetta\n34.\tDJ 3000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Flamuri I Popullit\n35.\tUntitled-Unknown\n\nsubmitted by sprus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323d6f6f8270e5dac0581797ccfeec042fdcc473","amp;dn":"Derrick+May+-+Music+LiveBBC+6+Music+Programmes+6+Mix+02-05-2010+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323d6f6f8270e5dac0581797ccfeec042fdcc473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,61,111,111,130,112,229,218,192,88,23,151,204,254,236,4,47,220,196,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
