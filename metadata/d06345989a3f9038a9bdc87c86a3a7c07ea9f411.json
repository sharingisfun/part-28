They have difficulties in finding places where they can sleep together. But this is the only problem they do solve. All four justly feel miserable because their lives are meaningless (the recurrent dull and poorly kept house faÃƒÂ§ads could well be taken as a comparative symbol). In addition, everyone is so absorbed by his or her own distress and hardly capable of bothering about the anguish of the others. The three days end with a pervasive lack of contact.\n\nMore info: https://board.freakyflicks.es/showthread.php?tid=1506\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
