She's survived the hard streets of Manhattan, and she's built a home - and a family - for herself, with her friends Tatiana, Bobby Soul, and his Li'l Bro. But with fewer than 200 mutants left on the planet, Kiden's become a target - and when somebody strikes at one of her friends, Kiden's going to find out just how much farther she can fall! \n\nWritten by New York Times best-selling writer Marjorie M.
