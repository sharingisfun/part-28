A former reporter for The Washington Post and The Newark Star-Ledger, he lives in Virginia.\n\n0.50. The Nightgown (2012): Shamus and Nero award-winning author Brad Parks takes readers back to the beginning of investigative reporter Carter RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career with this intriguing prequel short story.\n\nOnly 24 years old and still a wide-eyed reporter for a tiny backwater newspaper, Ross is getting his crack at the big leagues with an interview at New JerseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest paper, The Eagle-Examiner. IfÃ¢â‚¬â€that isÃ¢â‚¬â€he nails the interview and the on-the-spot writing test. Ross has never had a problem spinning a story, but provided with notes he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take and quotes he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hear it feels flat, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so sure about his chances.\n\nSo when a car crashes into a building in a nearby town and Carter overhears the assignments editor complaining that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no one left in the building whom she can send out to cover the story, Carter jumps at the chance and quickly finds himself dangerously close to being in over his head in The Nightgown, another stellar addition to Brad ParksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acclaimed mystery series.\n\n01. Faces of the Gone (Dec.2009)\nFour bodies, each with a single bullet wound in the back of the head, stacked like cordwood in a weed-choked vacant lot: That's the front-page news facing Carter Ross, investigative reporter with the Newark Eagle-Examiner. Immediately dispatched to the scene, Carter learns that the four victims - an exotic dancer, a drug dealer, a hustler, and a mama's boy - came from different parts of the city and didn't seem to know one another.\nThe police, eager to calm jittery residents, leak a theory that the murders are revenge for a bar stickup, and Carter's paper, hungry for a scoop, hastily prints it. Carter doesn't come from the streets, but he understands a thing or two about Newark's neighborhoods. And he knows there are no quick answers when dealing with a crime like this.\nDetermined to uncover the true story, he enlists the aide of Tina Thompson, the paper's smoking-hot city editor, to run interference at the office; Tommy Hernandez, the paper's gay Cuban intern, to help him with legwork on the streets; and Tynesha Dales, a local stripper, to take him to Newark's underside. It turns out that the four victims have one connection after all, and this knowledge will put Carter on the path of one very ambitious killer.\nTreading the same literary turf as Harlan Coben, and writing with a fresh Jersey voice, Brad Parks makes an energetic, impressive debut. \n\n02. Eyes of the Innocent (Feb 2011): Carter Ross, the sometimes-dashing investigative reporter for the Newark Eagle-Examiner, is back, and reporting on the latest tragedy to befall Newark, New Jersey, a fast-moving house fire that kills two boys.\n\nWith the help of the paperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newest intern, a bubbly blonde known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Thang,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Carter finds the victimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mother, Akilah Harris, who spins a tale of woe about a mortgage rate reset that forced her to work two jobs and leave her young boys without child care. Carter turns in a front-page feature, but soon discovers Akilah isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what she seems. And neither is the fire.\n\nWhen Newark councilman Windy Byers is reported missing, it launches Carter into the sordid world of urban house-flipping and Jersey-style political corruption. With his usual mix of humor, compassion, and street smarts, Carter is soon calling on some of his friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€gay Cuban sidekick Tommy Hernandez, T-shirt-selling buddy Tee Jamison, and on-and-off girlfriend Tina ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â€for help in tracking down the shadowy figure behind it all.\n\nBrad ParksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut, Faces of the Gone, won the Shamus Award and Nero Award for Best American Mystery. It was heralded as an engaging mix of Harlan Coben and Janet Evanovich. Now Parks solidifies his place as one of the brightest new talents in crime fiction with this authentic, entertaining thriller.\n\n&quot;Once again, Parks, a former Washington Post reporter, deftly brings the personalities and dynamics of a modern-day city newsroom to life.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\n03. The Girl Next Door (March 2012): Reading his own newspaperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obituaries, veteran reporter Carter Ross comes across that of a woman named Nancy Marino, who was the victim of a hit-and-run while she was on the job delivering copies of that very paper, the Eagle-Examiner. Struck by the opportunity to write a heroic piece about an everyday woman killed too young, he heads to her wake to gather tributes and anecdotes. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the last place Ross expects to find controversyÃ¢â‚¬â€which is exactly what happens when one of NancyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sisters convinces him that the accident might not have been accidental at all.\n\nIt turns out that the kind and generous Nancy may have made a few enemies, starting with her boss at the diner where she was a part-time waitress, and even including the publisher of the Eagle-Examiner. CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation of this seemingly simple story soon has him in big trouble with his full-time editor and sometime girlfriend, Tina Thompson, not to mention the rest of his bosses at the paper, but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let it goÃ¢â‚¬â€the story is just too good, and it keeps getting better. But will his nose for trouble finally take him too far?\n\nBrad ParksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart-mouthed, quick-witted reporter returns in The Girl Next DoorÃ¢â‚¬â€another action-packed entry in his award-winning series, written with an unforgettable mix of humor and suspense.\n\n04. The Good Cop (March 2013): As long as Newark Eagle-Examiner reporter Carter Ross turns in his stories on deadline, no one bats an eye if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wander into the newsroom until 10 or 11 in the morning. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an unpleasant surprise when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awakened at 8:38 a.m. by a phone call from his boss, telling him a local policeman was killed and to get the story. Shaking himself awake, Carter heads off to interview the copÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow. And then he gets another call: the storyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s off, the cop committed suicide.\n\nBut Carter canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand why a man with a job he loved, a beautiful wife, and plans to take his adorable children to Disney World would suddenly kill himself. And when CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to learn more are repeatedly blocked, it's clear someone knows more than he's saying about the cop's death. The question is, who? And what does he have to hide? Carter, with his usual single-minded devotion to a good storyÃ¢â‚¬â€and to the memory of a Newark policemanÃ¢â‚¬â€will do whatever it takes to uncover the truth.\n\nIn The Good Cop, Brad Parks is back with all the humor, charm, and human insight his readers have come to expect, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:703abbd14b158011d6a58308a36c669fa8722100","amp;dn":"Carter+Ross+Mystery+series+by+Brad+Parks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"703abbd14b158011d6a58308a36c669fa8722100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,58,187,209,75,21,128,17,214,165,131,8,163,108,102,159,168,114,33,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
