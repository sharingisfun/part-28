The band is composed of David &quot;Oderus Urungus&quot; Brockie (Vocals/bass), Brad &quot;Jizmak Da Gusha&quot; Roberts (Drums), and Mike &quot;Balsac the Jaws of Death&quot; Derks (Guitar). DBX is a pet project of GWAR and shows some of their earlier punk roots from the &quot;Death Piggy&quot; era. At their shows they play some original DBX songs as well as some tunes from Death Piggy, GWAR, and X-Cops. The band enjoys a following mostly made up of GWAR fans. Dave Brockie has hinted at the possibility of the band&amp;#039;s breakup in the past due to the exhausting nature of lower-budget touring.\n\n\nIncluded here are the following two albums:\n\nDiarrhea of a Madman (2001) (MP3 128 - 192 kbps)\nSongs for the Wrong  (2003) (MP3 192 - 224 kbps)\n\n+ two extra tracks:\nYou Fucked Up/Keep On Rockin&amp;#039; Me (live) (MP3 160 kbps)\nPaddy Wagon Rape (live)                 (MP3 160 kbps)\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPS! I couldn&amp;#039;t find any torrents containing these albums, so I had to download all tracks one by one by using Limewire, this explains the various bitrates used in the  MP3 files. It took quite some time to get absolutely all tracks too.\n\n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oderus.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oderus.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oderus.com/timewasters/dbx/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oderus.com/timewasters/dbx/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gwar.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gwar.net&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://slavepitinc.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://slavepitinc.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAs with all my MP3 torrents, all files are properly named &amp; tagged.\n\nCheck out my other torrents here: www.thepiratebay.se/user/ElgerHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe93c57af37f51c3cf8ad7a17ae0b45abe248401","amp;dn":"2+albums+of+Dave+Brockie+Experience+%28punk-rock-metal%29+%5BElgerHz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe93c57af37f51c3cf8ad7a17ae0b45abe248401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,147,197,122,243,127,81,195,207,138,215,161,122,224,180,90,190,36,132,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
