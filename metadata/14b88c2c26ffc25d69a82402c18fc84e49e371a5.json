National Geographic has quite the deal for you. Sit right back and follow narrator James Coburn on a journey into Arctic Kingdom: Life on the Edge. From a slippery tour of the arctic ice to a dizzying tumble down the rugged cliffs of Lancaster Sound's Prince Leopold Island.\n\nOnly the strong survive at the top of the world. Stalk the Arctic ice with its fiercest predator, the polar bear, as it prowls one of the most forbidding places on the planet - a hidden kingdom of magnificent creatures. Armed with a keen sense of smell and backed up by 1,700 pounds of fur and fangs, the polar bear stands alone at the top of the food chain. \n\nYet many other hunters manage to survive in and around harsh Arctic waters, from the savvy arctic fox to the massive, whiskered walrus. The Arctic ice is revealed as a place of danger and drama where animals are stranded on frozen waters, trapped between moving sheets of ice, and caught in the struggle to survive. Brave the world that nature has to offer for a rare visit to the ARCTIC KINGDOM: LIFE AT THE EDGE.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATED BY: James Coburn\n-------------------------\n\n\nYear:  1995\nFile Size: 697 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:54:18\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 576x432\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1752 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 122 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (External English)\n\n  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864952/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864952/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n***********************************\n*                                 *\n*   MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL!!  *\n*                                 *\n***********************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b88c2c26ffc25d69a82402c18fc84e49e371a5","amp;dn":"Arctic+Kingdom+Life+At+The+Edge-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b88c2c26ffc25d69a82402c18fc84e49e371a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,184,140,44,38,255,194,93,105,168,36,2,193,143,200,78,73,227,113,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
