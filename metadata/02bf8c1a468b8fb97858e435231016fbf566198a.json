It's cheap, easy to use, and easy to recycle. It's lightweight and easy to cut or tear--but incredibly strong when folded, layered, or rolled. It can stand stiff as a board, pop up like a spring, or hang softly like a silk scarf. It's disposable, but it can last for centuries. Its surface can be rough, or creamy smooth, or shiny. Sometimes it's so thin you can see through it; other times, it's thick enough to hold globs of paint. But it can also be beautiful, all on its own.\r\n\r\nThe projects in Paper Inventions were inspired by the many different varieties of paper, from fancy artists' watercolor paper to recycled copy paper, and the many different ways it is used. Whether you like to make crafts or play with electronics, there's a project that will challenge you and unleash your creativity.\r\n\r\nProjects in this book include:\r\n\r\nDIY flavored edible paper and ink\r\nSelf-folding paper models\r\nLight-up paper projects\r\nPaper sensors and switches\r\nPaper windmill and paper machines\r\n3D designs with paper\r\nOrigami and other fold and cut designs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02bf8c1a468b8fb97858e435231016fbf566198a","amp;dn":"Make+-+Paper+Inventions+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02bf8c1a468b8fb97858e435231016fbf566198a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,191,140,26,70,139,143,185,120,88,228,53,35,16,22,251,245,102,25,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
