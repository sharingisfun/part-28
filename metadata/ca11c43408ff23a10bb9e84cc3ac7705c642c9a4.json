The three non-album tracks the box includes are grace notes rather than lost jewels, but the point of the set is to be a Rosetta stone of album rock, the stairway to a gaudy paradise that they constructed.\nDetails\nArtist: Led Zeppelin\nAlbum: Complete Studio Recordings\nRelease Date: September 28, 1993\nLabel: Atlantic\nGenre: Rock\nCodec: mp3\nFile Type: Zip\nFile Size: 591 MB\nBit Rate: 192 kbps\nCover Included\nTrack Listings Included\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\nDisc: 1\n1.
