Over the years, they made many recordings together, but this one is unique. Recorded while on a 1981 tour of Europe, Guy and Wells took a break from their backing musicians and amps to cut this spontaneous, all acoustic set. The results stand in stark contrast to the steamy Chicago blues the duo is best known for. Instead, these recordings are relaxed and personal, with an intimate, back-porch feel. Guy switches between six and twelve string guitars and lays down rootsy acoustic rhythms for Wells' tasteful harmonica lines. The two share vocal duties on the performances as they pay homage to the rural, country blues roots these modern bluesmen share.\n\n\nReviewed in HiFi+ Issue 45 by Reuben Parry :\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tFantastic transparency, a jaw dropping presentation of rough hewed vocal dynamic shifts and the kind of inner details that scream &quot;intimacy&quot; recreates the atmospheric roots of the Deep South - making this a must own record from a sonic perspective as well. Guy and Wells chew over those gristle and bone themes that have preoccupied generations (both through their own songs and those penned by the likes of John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and Sunny Joe) and in the process they reveal the full width, depth, scale and cultural impact of the blues legacy.\nRECORDING 10/10\nMUSIC 9/10\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nTracklisting\n\nSide 1: Boogie Chillen/IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m In The Mood/DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Leave Me/Give Me My Coat And Shoes*/ Medley:Baby What You Want Me To Do/ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Allright**\nSide 2: Big Boat(Buddy and JuniorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Thing)/High Heel Sneakers/My Home Is In The Delta/Wrong Doing Woman/DigginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ My Potatoes\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBuddy Guy : acoustic six strings guitar on all tunes except * on which he plays a twelve strings guitar.
