Longtime Pedro Almodovar collaborator Alberto Iglesias provides a soft, spacious, and ultimately devastating score that utilizes native instrumentation like the marimba, thumb harp, and ronroco. Iglesias uses this folk instrumentation as a base for orchestrations that are as beautiful as they are anxious, resulting in a soundtrack with a distinct sense of place that's contemporary enough to engross listeners from any cultural standpoint. Highlights include &quot;Roadblock,&quot; &quot;Procession,&quot; and two outstanding pieces from Kenyan-born worldbeat artist Ayub Ogada.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6abf7b385d5220ea4c992abc4ce508b8616998e5","amp;dn":"Alberto_Iglesias-The_Constant_Gardener_OST-2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6abf7b385d5220ea4c992abc4ce508b8616998e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,191,123,56,93,82,32,234,76,153,42,188,76,229,8,184,97,105,152,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
