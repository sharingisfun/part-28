Herlihy has dedicated many years of research and study to uncovering this history, and the result is a comprehensive genealogy of the two-wheeled savior of mass transit. In the late 1700s, when transportation was ruled by the horse and buggy, inventors challenged one another to develop a human-powered vehicle to replace the inconvenience and expense of the horse-drawn carriage and make man, once and for all, self-sufficient. It took nearly 200 years for the four-wheeled, multi-person machines first thought to be the answer to this dilemma to evolve into the two-wheeled speedsters we know today. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid account of this story could not be more detailed if Herlihy himself had personally lived through every experience he recounts. Each chapter is filled with eye-catching illustrations and photographs spanning nearly two centuries, and colorful sidebars like &quot;The Velocipede in the Service of Love&quot; and &quot;Women and the Velocipede&quot; add character to the often technical, textbook-style prose. In uncovering interesting characters like 1860Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s racer James Moore, who predicted bicycles would soon be &quot;as common in homes as umbrellas,&quot; and documenting hundreds of little known facts, Herlihy takes what could have been just another history book and makes it a story worth telling your friends about.\n\n\nFrom The New Yorker\nThe bicycle began life, in the nineteenth century, as a diversion for rich Europeans. Physicians, theologians, anti-feminists, and journalists condemned it as a hazardous fadÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Man is a locomotive machine of Nature's own making, not to be improved by the addition of any cranks or wheels of mortal invention,&quot; wrote one opponentÃ¢â‚¬â€and cyclists were sometimes set upon by mobs. By the century's end, however, with a safe, efficient model available to the commuter and the Sunday pleasure seeker, the bicycle created thousands of jobs, spurred road construction, and transformed fashion, while daredevil, brandy-swilling racing cyclists acquired heroic status. Herlihy portrays the men who pioneered this gravity-defying wonder; they worked in near-obscurity, lit by the Industrial Age's spirit of invention, the capitalist impulse, and the utopian hope that the bicycle would &quot;take men away from the gambling rooms and rum shops, out into God's light and sunshine.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bicycle-History-David-V-Herlihy/dp/0300120478/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344338775&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bicycle+the+history&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bicycle-History-David-V-Herlihy/dp/0300120478/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344338775&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bicycle+the+history&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef336af01abbb178526b5bfb46237b729fcb862","amp;dn":"Bicycle%3A+The+History+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ef336af01abbb178526b5bfb46237b729fcb862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,243,54,175,1,171,187,23,133,38,181,191,180,98,55,183,41,252,184,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
