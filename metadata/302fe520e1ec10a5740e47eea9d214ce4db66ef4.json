There are 23 of them here, as a matter of fact.  That's because I've finally been able to sort through some unorganized directories on my hard drive yesterday.  And I realized I had quite a few 2013 singles that weren't previously shared.\n\nBut including the 47 new titles in this 38th bundle today, I have now reached my goal for 2013, as we have collectively shared 1,031 Christian Music releases amongst ourselves.  Praise God!\n\nFinal point I'd like to make.  If anyone happened to read my 37th bundle thread, I've decided to share a few more discographies in the coming days ahead.  Prior to now, I've not shared any discographies since last May.  Mainly because they're not well supported once they're fully seeded.  It's a little disheartening when I revisit a discography a mere 24 hours after torrenting it, only to find out that it's dead because none of the seeders stuck around.\n\nBut putting that aside, I will try and torrent about 20 or so discographies.  And see how that goes.  So if you have been wanting to see something new, please let it be known in the thread below.  If I have what you're looking for, and I have the time and resources to share it, I'll do my best.  But please, keep your requests limited to say two or three discographies so I can meet the needs of others.\n\nBundle #38 includes the following 47 releases...\n\n * Alex Ishkov - 2013 - Alex Ishkov EP\n * Behind The Veil - 2013 - Behind The Veil - Live\n * Chas Hathaway - 2013 - Gazelem - Single\n * Chas Hathaway - 2013 - He Lives - Favorite Hymns\n * Chas Hathaway - 2013 - Moonlight Sonata - Single\n * Chas Hathaway - 2013 - Peace Be Still - Favorite Hymns\n * Circle Of Hope Audio Art - 2013 - Resist And Restore - Spring 2013\n * Civil Wars, The - 2013 - The One That Got Away - Single\n * Cold War Kids - 2013 - Tuxedos EP\n * Colin Lundstrom - 2013 - Sweetly\n * Dana Dirksen - 2013 - A Free Gift For Our Redeemer Friends\n * David Archuleta - 2013 - Don't Run Away - Single\n * David Glenn - 2013 - Great King - Single\n * DavidB - 2013 - The Worship Collection\n * DJ SoCo - 2013 - Souled Out 7\n * Doc Jones - 2013 - My Strength - Single\n * Dust - 2013 - Nothing On Me - Single\n * Flo - 2013 - Let's Ride - Single\n * For King And Country - 2013 - Hope Is What We Crave\n * Hardieavenue - 2013 - At The End - Single\n * J-Bitt - 2013 - Madness - Single\n * J-Bitt - 2013 - More Than Conquerors - Single\n * Jaimeo Brown - 2013 - Transcendence\n * James Small - 2013 - The James Small EP\n * Jamie N Commons - 2013 - Lead Me Home - Single\n * Jonny Lang - 2013 - Fight For My Soul\n * Keonte - 2013 - Let God Down - Single\n * Micki Miller - 2013 - Love Letters EP\n * Mumford And Sons - 2013 - I Will Wait - Single\n * New Eyes - 2013 - What We Do In Secret\n * One Republic - 2013 - If I Lose Myself - Single\n * One Republic - 2013 - What You Wanted - Single\n * Paramore - 2013 - Now - Single\n * Richard Jensen - 2013 - Order Of Service\n * Richard Jensen - 2013 - Regenerate\n * Rocket Summer - 2013 - Anna - Single\n * Sean C Johnson - 2013 - Dear Me - Single\n * Sean C Johnson - 2013 - Grateful\n * Sean C Johnson - 2013 - MLMX - Single\n * Skillet - 2013 - Not Gonna Die - Single\n * Social Club - 2013 - Animal Kingdom - Single\n * Switchfoot - 2013 - Fading West EP\n * Twenty One Pilots - 2013 - Fake You Out - Single\n * Various - 2013 - The Good Christian Music Blog - Summer Mixtape, Vol 1\n * Veto - 2013 - Broadway\n * Willamette Christian Church - 2013 - Contact\n * Young King David - 2013 - Legal Money - Single\n\nHe Above All,\nTorrentTracts - September 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302fe520e1ec10a5740e47eea9d214ce4db66ef4","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+38%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302fe520e1ec10a5740e47eea9d214ce4db66ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,47,229,32,225,236,16,165,116,14,71,238,169,210,20,206,77,182,110,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
