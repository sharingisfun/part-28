Jay Berry Lee's grandpa had an explanation, of course--as he did for most things. The monkeys had escaped from a traveling circus, and there was a handsome reward in store for anyone who could catch them. Grandpa said there wasn't any animal that couldn't be caught somehow, and Jay Berry started out believing him . . .\n\nBut by the end of the &quot;summer of the monkeys,&quot; Jay Berry Lee had learned a lot more than he ever bargained for--and not just about monkeys. He learned about faith, and wishes coming true, and knowing what it is you really want. He even learned a little about growing up . . .\n\nThis novel, set in rural Oklahoma around the turn of the century, is a heart-warming family story--full of rich detail and delightful characters--about a time and place when miracles were really the simplest of things...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9d869928eb26e9a3ee92224a3257d592792d97","amp;dn":"Summer+of+The+Monkeys+-+Wilson+Rawls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9d869928eb26e9a3ee92224a3257d592792d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,157,134,153,40,235,38,233,163,238,146,34,74,50,87,213,146,121,45,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
