There she met a professor named Pierre Curie, and the two soon married, forming one of the most famous scientific partnerships in history. Together they discovered two elements and won a Nobel Prize in 1903. (Later Marie won another Nobel award for chemistry in 1911.) She died in Savoy, France, on July 4, 1934, a victim of many years of exposure to toxic radiation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f921f8c7d53289ebfe8edfb28f9d907f113a69b1","amp;dn":"Who+Was+Marie+Curie+-+Megan+Stine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f921f8c7d53289ebfe8edfb28f9d907f113a69b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,33,248,199,213,50,137,235,254,142,223,178,143,157,144,127,17,58,105,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
