Rat is abused and tortured in his new home, but a depression is on and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tough time for a young man to be on his own. When RatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loyal childhood friend Mitch Morris intervenes and the sheriff rescues Rat, his luck changes.\n\nLanding a job at last, Rat rides shotgun for the Western Stage Company out of Fort Worth. He quickly picks up a reputation as a crack shot, and as business increases, Rat is able to save towards the small ranch heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d always dreamed of.\n\nHis steady routine is interrupted when the hero of his childhood, Sheriff Cathcart, asks him to become his deputy. RatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first duty as deputy is to track down the Oxenberg gang, one of the deadliest groups of bandits in all of Texas. When he draws close to his quarry, Rat is faced with one of the toughest lessons of his life: friendship and old loyalties donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always square with justice and the law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29b88359ba41c692070f081aa68b4c84c05a729a","amp;dn":"Boswell%27s+Luck+-+G+Clifton+Wisler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29b88359ba41c692070f081aa68b4c84c05a729a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,184,131,89,186,65,198,146,7,15,8,26,166,139,76,132,192,90,114,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
