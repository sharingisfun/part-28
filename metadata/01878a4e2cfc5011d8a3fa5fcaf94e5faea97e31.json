Then uninstall it, and login to your new hack with the username to get back your progress. Google+ doesn't work on this hack and facebook sync requires facebook to be uninstalled and reinstalled. so username is the easiest method to keep progress.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01878a4e2cfc5011d8a3fa5fcaf94e5faea97e31","amp;dn":"Family+Guy%3A+The+Quest+for+Stuff+hack+%2Afully+working+update%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01878a4e2cfc5011d8a3fa5fcaf94e5faea97e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,135,138,78,44,252,80,17,216,163,250,95,202,249,78,95,174,169,126,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
