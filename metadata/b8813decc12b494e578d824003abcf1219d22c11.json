The album includes early examples of World and Rap (!), but failed to make much of an impression, and consequently is now rare and collectable in vinyl format.\n\nThe follow up album &quot;Charge!&quot; was released a year later. It had an excellent Roger Dean sleeve, and represented a major improvement on the rather lacklustre debut album. &quot;Charge!&quot; explored interesting progressive rock areas, combining folk influences (&quot;Watching The World Pass By&quot; ) with rock and roll (&quot;Well We Might&quot; ), and psychedelic rock (&quot;Mix Your Mind With The Moonbeams&quot; ). The diverse style of the album make it difficult to pinpoint influences, but there's a bit of GENESIS, BJH, URIAH HEEP and possibly JETHRO TULL.\n\nThe band only released the two albums, before their lack of success led to frustration, and they disbanded in 1972. Lou Stonebridge found success with MCGUINNESS FLINT, while Pete Soley formed SNAFU with Mickey Moody. Peter Beckett joined the band PLAYER as vocalist, and Keith Webb found work as drummer with various outfits. \n\n[IMG]http://img485.imageshack.us/img485/6048/paladinfront1attch9cm.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTracks\nPaladin.1971\nSide-A\n1.
