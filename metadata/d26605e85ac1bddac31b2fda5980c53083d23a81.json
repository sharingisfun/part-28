Musically, keys, melodica, drums, and guitars collide with three joyful voices howling. It's fun...&quot; - Stereogum\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lumbering drums, jangling shakers, electronic squiggles, and whimsical, ragged shouts accompany the strutting bass line and stomping guitar. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all just loose and playful enough to avoid coming across as overly nostalgic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Pitchfork","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26605e85ac1bddac31b2fda5980c53083d23a81","amp;dn":"Drink+Up+Buttercup+-+Born+And+Thrown+On+A+Hook+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26605e85ac1bddac31b2fda5980c53083d23a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,102,5,232,90,193,189,218,195,27,47,218,89,128,197,48,131,210,58,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
