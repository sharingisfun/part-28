Co-starring Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne and Liam Neeson in one of his first roles, Excalibur shows the whole splendour of that time, from the impressive battle scenes up to the romantic ones.\nOther features\nLength 135 min \nDiscs 1 \nRegion 2 \nVideo Pal\n1.85:1, 16:9 \nLanguages Dolby Digital 5.1: English .
