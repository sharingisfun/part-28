From early '90s to today, Max Grillo kept bringing the freshest psytrance and techno to both festival and club crowds, all over Brazil and Europe. As being a supporter and hunter of modern and innovative sounds, the connection with Serbian artists was a natural step and this compilation of finest psy and progressive trance is the result of this connection.\n 10 tracks from regular and upcoming TesseracTstudio artists on the CD also include 2 tracks by artists from Brazil. As the summer draws near the festival euphoria is already in the air, so let the music add up to the experience while you plan your next adventure!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc3b799783b75d5061623ddd6bd0519a9691fd0","amp;dn":"VA+-+Serbia+Brasil+Connection+%28Compiled+By+Max+Grillo%29+2014+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc3b799783b75d5061623ddd6bd0519a9691fd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,195,183,153,120,59,117,213,6,22,35,221,214,189,5,25,169,105,31,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
