The oldest brother was considered the best songster in the family, and certainly his performances here are throwbacks to a more archaic style, although he's an amazingly energetic performer. Middle brother Joel is the crudest of the three, surprising since he's the one of the three who spent the most time around mentor Blind Lemon Jefferson. These are loose, conversational recordings made with a single microphone. They capture three brothers enjoying each other's company immensely. (AllMusic)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lightning Hopkins is well-known to fans of country blues, but this casual recording places his music in an entirely more interesting context. Rather than presenting Hopkins as an 'artist,' above and apart from his audience, this disc affords us the chance to hear Lightning and his brothers as equals; an unrehearsed family get together which happened to include some three-way music making. Mostly recorded in 1964, when these men were all 60-ish, some cuts are understandably a bit rough. But it also reminds us of a time when music-making was a social activity, a means of amusement as well as entertainment, a chance to show off a little, a way to tell some tall tales, a way to have fun. The directness of many of these songs indicates that they are improvised (`See About My Brother John Henry,' 'I Got a Brother in Waxahachie,' `I Want to Go Fishing,' 'Home With Mama'), but that's part of the appeal. All three brothers are talented: Lightning's success and the others' obscurity also offers some lessons about luck and fate.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (arhoolie)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - See About My Brother John Henry (Lightnin')\n02 - Hot Blooded Woman (John Henry)\n03 - Black Hannah (Lightnin' &amp; John Henry)\n04 - I Want To Go Fishing (John Henry)\n05 - Doin' Little Heiffer (John Henry)\n06 - Hey, Baby Hey (John Henry)\n07 - Saddle Up My Grey Mare (John Henry)\n08 - Tell Me, Tell Me (John Henry)\n09 - Little Girl (Lightnin')\n10 - I Got A Brother In Waxahachie (Lightnin')\n11 - Matchbox Blues (Joel)\n12 - Home With Mama (Joel)\n13 - Come Down To My House (Lightnin')\n14 - Grosebeck Blues (Lightnin' &amp; Joel)\n15 - The Dice Game (told by Lightnin')\n16 - I Walked From Dallas (Joel)\n17 - Two Brothers Playing - Going Back To Baden-Baden (Lightnin' &amp; Joel)\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fdbf5f67108d61a1bb54ab5b55382b410ef261b","amp;dn":"The+Hopkins+Brothers+-+The+Hopkins+Brothers+-+1964+-+Joel%2C+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fdbf5f67108d61a1bb54ab5b55382b410ef261b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,219,245,246,113,8,214,26,27,181,74,181,181,83,130,180,16,239,38,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
