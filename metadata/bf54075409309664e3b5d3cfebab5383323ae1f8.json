Though the test of time has not been set, I'll take the chance of saying that Gutter Rainbows contains ready-made classics that will undoubtedly become highlights of Talib's career. It's album you can listen through without skipping a track, and a sound that resonates so powerfully that it's difficult to enter a new song without first exiting the last. \n\nSumology: an undeniably colorful album that is rife with diversity; on par with the solo Ear Drum, and an applaudable follow-up to last year's Reflection Eternal collab Revolutions Per Minute.&quot;\n\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nNo. \tTitle \t\t \t\t\t\tLength\n1. \t&quot;After the Rain&quot;    \t\t\t\t1:27\n2. \t&quot;Gutter Rainbows&quot;    \t\t\t\t4:11\n3. \t&quot;So Low&quot;   \t\t\t\t\t3:15\n4. \t&quot;Palookas&quot; (featuring Sean Price) \t \t3:58\n5. \t&quot;Mr. International&quot; (featuring Nigel Hall)  \t3:37\n6. \t&quot;I'm on One&quot;   \t\t\t\t\t3:55\n7. \t&quot;Wait for You&quot; (featuring Kendra Ross) \t\t3:46\n8. \t&quot;Ain't Waiting&quot; (featuring Outasight) \t \t3:58\n9. \t&quot;Cold Rain&quot;   \t\t\t\t\t2:36\n10. \t&quot;Friends &amp; Family&quot;   \t\t\t\t3:58\n11. \t&quot;Tater Tot&quot;   \t\t\t\t\t2:57\n12. \t&quot;How You Love Me&quot; (featuring Blaq Toven) \t4:05\n13. \t&quot;Uh Oh&quot; (featuring Jean Grae) \t\t\t4:16\n14. \t&quot;Self Savior&quot; (featuring Chace Infinite)  \t3:14\n\n\nReleased here for you in lossless quality FLAC with proper tags and artwork.
