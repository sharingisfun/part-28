My mother always said to stay away from boys with ink, but she ignored her own advice. She also abandoned me and my little sister.\n\nLife's been hard for the two of us, on the run and on our own, but I just turned twenty-one and started working at a bar in a new city. I wear a fake wedding band and a veil of lies.\n\nMy gold ring didn't stop Sawyer. He looked into me with his heavenly green eyes, and I nearly forgot my pretty lies. Now he wants to help me get my life together.\n\nI should stay away, because he could blow my cover. When we get foundÃ¢â‚¬â€and I know one day we willÃ¢â‚¬â€I want my sister to be old enough to handle the truth about our past.\n\nI may be hanging out with Sawyer, but we're definitely not dating. I swear, he's not setting me on fire with every glance or casual touch. We're just friends. I'm not thinking about him wrapping those tattooed arms around me, every second of every day.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a62e8a3fb69cd0a7712d08379c12793e09982ce","amp;dn":"For+You+-+Strong%2C+Mimi.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a62e8a3fb69cd0a7712d08379c12793e09982ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,98,232,163,251,105,205,10,119,18,208,131,121,193,39,147,224,153,130,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
