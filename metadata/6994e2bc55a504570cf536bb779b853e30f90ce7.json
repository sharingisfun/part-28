She tells him to leave the building immediately. He doesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦just before it explodes, killing everyone inside. Lucy vanishes, and Sam wakes up in a prison cell. As the lone survivor of the attack, he is branded by the CIA as a murderer and a traitor.\n\nEscaping from the agency, Sam launches into a desperate hunt to save his kidnapped wife and child, and to reveal the unknown enemy who has set him up and stolen his family. But the destruction of SamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life was only step one in an extraordinary plotÃ¢â‚¬â€and now Sam must become a new kind of hero.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST MINUTE\n\nSam Capra must commit an impossible assassination--or he will lose the only person in the world who matters to him . . .\nSam Capra has one reason to live: to rescue his baby son from the people who abducted him. An ex-CIA agent, Sam now owns bars around the world as cover for his real mission-working undercover for a secret network as mysterious as it is powerful, while using his skills to find his child.\nNow the kidnappers have offered a deadly deal: they'll surrender Sam's child...if Sam finds and murders the one man who can expose them. Teaming up with a desperate young mother whose daughter is also missing, Sam tracks his prey-and his son-across the country in a dangerous race against time, and must unravel a deadly conspiracy if he's to rescue the only person in the world that matters to him.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6994e2bc55a504570cf536bb779b853e30f90ce7","amp;dn":"Jeff+Abbott+-+1.+Adrenaline+2.+The+Last+Minute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6994e2bc55a504570cf536bb779b853e30f90ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,148,226,188,85,165,4,87,12,245,54,187,119,155,133,62,48,249,12,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
