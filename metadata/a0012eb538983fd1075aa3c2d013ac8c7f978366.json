It is entitled &quot;One&quot; primarily because of this -- that everything was done by one voice, his voice, as an enduring legacy to his career as a Filipino musician.\n\nThis album was launched in 1981, the first year of that decade, and is the first of a series of albums he brings out to the world, as a further highlight to the theme &quot;One.&quot; The second was &quot;One Christmas,&quot; launched in 1991.\n\nIt is with pride and honor that I share this with you.\n\nKuya George","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0012eb538983fd1075aa3c2d013ac8c7f978366","amp;dn":"Ryan+Cayabyab%5C%27s+One+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0012eb538983fd1075aa3c2d013ac8c7f978366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,1,46,181,56,152,63,209,7,90,163,194,208,19,172,140,127,151,131,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
