Armed only with antiquated studio-hardware, a polybag full of Shulgin\\\\\\'s finest, and reinforced by a nearby Funktion One vendor, he set about creating the conditions for a series of musical events on his own terms.\n\nThe terms and conditions were simple: *do whatever you want*.\n\nNow, in the autumn of 2011, the sounds of this musical journey are ready to make their way into the World.\n\n01.
