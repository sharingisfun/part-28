Her sustainable diet not only brings to light societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unhealthy dependency on mass-produced, prepackaged foods but also helps her reconnect with her body and her environment.\n\nLike Barbara KingsolverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Animal, Vegetable, Miracle and the bestselling books of Michael Pollan, Blessing the Hands That Feed Us is part personal narrative and part global manifesto. By challenging herself to eat and buy local, Robin exposes the cause and effect of the food business, from the processed goods laden with sugar, fat, and preservatives to the trucks burning through fuel to bring them to a shelf near you.\n\nRobinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey is also one of community as she befriends all the neighboring farmers who epitomize the sustainable lifestyle. Among them are Tricia, the prolific market gardener who issued RobinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 10-mile challenge; Britt and Eric, two\nyoung, enthusiastic farmers living their dream of self-sufficiency; and Vicky, a former corporate executive turned milk producer.\n\nFeaturing recipes throughout, along with practical tips on adopting your own locally sourced diet, Blessing the Hands That Feed Us is an inspirational guide and testimonial to the locavore movement and a healthy food future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5af4eb68cf14484c8a94ee2cad23e2ce498999","amp;dn":"Blessing+the+Hands+That+Feed+Us+%282014%29+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5af4eb68cf14484c8a94ee2cad23e2ce498999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,90,244,235,104,207,20,72,76,138,148,238,44,173,35,226,206,73,137,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
