The first segment, in 1976, begins with the return of an artist, Gengnian to his wife, Xiuqing and son after several years of re-education during the Cultural Revolution. He returns however, with injured hands and can no longer continue as an artist. He instead hopes to cultivate artistic aspirations in his son, Xiangyang, who has taken to hurling stones at strangers with his friend Chicken Droppings. Though he eventually follows in his father's footsteps, Xiangyang resents his father's pressure and the two soon fall out.\n\nThe next segments, in 1987 when Xiangyang is a 19 year old, and 1999, when he is in his 30s, continue to chart the course of Xiangyang and Gengnian's tense relationship. It is a moving film depicting the tension between Xianyang and his parents and also the marital relationship between his parents. The sunflower returns throughout the movie as a theme.\n\n=======\n\nVideo : XViD | 1,234Kbps | 640x352 | 16:9 | 25fps\nAudio : AC3 | 384Kbps | CBR | 6 Chan | 48KHz\n\n=======\n\n6 Screens :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6BtPH#0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6BtPH#0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=======\n\nInitial Seeding will be slow.\nPlease help to seed.\nThank you.\n\n=======\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdbe80cea2603aa8f6745eaee51552b8cb309799","amp;dn":"Sunflower+-+2005+-+DVDRip.XViD.AC3.%5BEng+Sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdbe80cea2603aa8f6745eaee51552b8cb309799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,190,128,206,162,96,58,168,246,116,94,174,229,21,82,184,203,48,151,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
