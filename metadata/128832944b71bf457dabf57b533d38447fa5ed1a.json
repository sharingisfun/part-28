There are some hilarious Plantations, for one.  Not to mention a pretty hot performance.  I try not to compare shows - for a guy like me who&amp;#039;s never seen Zeppelin, they&amp;#039;re all damn good.  This one is better than most, even for a soundboard.  You soundboard lovers will effing love this one.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;ve never bothered to pick up a bootleg, and I don&amp;#039;t blame you if you haven&amp;#039;t, this is the one that you should start your collection with.  This (along with perhaps 08.31.69 - keep your eyes open for that one later in the series) is one of the most accessible shows out there - it doesn&amp;#039;t require what us old-heads call &quot;Bootleg Ears&quot; to listen to, and it won&amp;#039;t give you a headache from concentrating to hear through the tape hiss of generation after generation of cassette-to-cassette copies.  You&amp;#039;ll hear a band at its finest, in Los Angeles where they always played hotter, louder and longer, rocking the Forum over two full CDs.  Guys and gals, the original vinyl on this set will run you $95+, if you can find it, which you won&amp;#039;t.\n\n\nSetlist:\n\nDisc 1:\nRock And Roll\nCelebration Day\nBlack Dog\nOver The Hills And Far Away\nMisty Mountain Hop\nSince I&amp;#039;ve Been Lovin&amp;#039; You\nNo Quarter\nThe Song Remains The Same\nThe Rain Song\n\nDisc 2:\nDazed And Confused\nStairway To Heaven\n\nShare And Enjoy - please seed after downloading to a share ratio of 3.0 if possible.  My personal share ratio is over 100 total.\n\nTimD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128832944b71bf457dabf57b533d38447fa5ed1a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+05.31.1973+-+Bonzo%5C%27s+Birthday+Party+-+2CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128832944b71bf457dabf57b533d38447fa5ed1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,136,50,148,75,113,191,69,125,171,245,123,83,61,56,68,127,165,237,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
