This album is about relationships.  Tonio K looks at the world with the eye of a cynic and the heart of a true-believer. The humor is there, while lampooning society (&quot;Romeo Loves Jane&quot; and &quot;True Confessions&quot; and both great blasts), but the stark beauty of &quot;You Will Go Free&quot; and the heart-wrenching &quot;Perfect World&quot; (&quot;Cause I never had to walk away from anybody I wanted as much as I wanted you&quot;) show his heart is in control. \n\nA1 True Confessions   3:36 \nA2 Perfect World   4:08 \nA3 Romeo and Jane   3:43 \nA4 You Belong With Me   4:47 \nA5 Impressed   4:20 \nB1 I Handle Snakes   3:52 \nB2 Emotional War Games   3:51 \nB3 Living Doll   3:38 \nB4 You Don't Belong Here   5:43 \nB5 You Will Go Free   6:32 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af8a4da8408f1f6a1323c03c7329af018bfff99","amp;dn":"Tonio+K.+-++Romeo+Unchained+%5B1986%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af8a4da8408f1f6a1323c03c7329af018bfff99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,248,164,218,132,8,241,246,161,50,60,3,199,50,154,240,24,191,255,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
