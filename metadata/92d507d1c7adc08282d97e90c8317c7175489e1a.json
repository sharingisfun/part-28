I always understood that what I felt for music\nwasn't normal, that I wasn't just another kid who liked\nmusic, but it was only at the age of about 16, when we\nbought a PC for our home, that I had in my hands the ideal\ntool to venture in the world of music production.\n\nAt the beginning it was all just for fun. (...) I carried\non with doing it for a while longer until I discovered, at\nthe age of 20, the side of house music that still\nfascinates me: club or tribal house. (...)\n\nThe powerful vocals plus the absurd talent of such\nproducers as Thunderpuss, Junior Vasquez, Victor Calderone\nand others really made me disbelieve what I was listening.\n(...)\n\nFrom that moment I truly found myself. I knew what I\nwanted. That was when I started learning more about the\nclub house genre and improving my musical knowledge (...).\nI've always been computer-savvy, which also helped me a lot\nand allowed me to begin all the work you know today.
