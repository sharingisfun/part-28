They were the most commercially successful of\nMotowns acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the\nBillboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motowns main songwriting and production\nteam, HollandÃ¢â‚¬â€œDozierÃ¢â‚¬â€œHolland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, The Supremes rivaled The Beatles in worldwide\npopularity, and their success made it possible for future African American R&amp;B and soul musicians to find\nmainstream success..\n\n\n\n\n   1.
