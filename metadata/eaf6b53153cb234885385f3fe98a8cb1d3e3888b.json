Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\ndescription:\n\n&quot;Lee Griffith is a prophet among prophets, and his new book is the most brilliant reflection on Christianity and nonviolence to appear in the twenty-first century... Griffith offers both a scorching critique of the virtues and practices of the so-called American Empire and a prayerful plea that disciples of Jesus will at last begin to conspire with the Spirit of God in a way that subverts violence, economic injustice, and divisions among humanity. But what sets this book apart from other anti-empire books is that it commends nothing less than Christian anarchy Ã¢â‚¬â€ a biblical vision long ignored or flatly dismissed by even progressive Christians. In this sense, God Is Subversive is arguably the most creative expression of Christian radicalism today.&quot;\n\n--Michael G. Long, Elizabethtown College\n\n\nTo Lee Griffith, being a peacemaker means much more than sporting &quot;PEACE&quot; T-shirts or voting for left-wing political candidates. Peacemaking is for him a daily practice of community formation, lifestyle decisions, and prayer - ordinary living that is faithful to the gospel and happily out of sync with most of the world most of the time - and it is a vital part of following Jesus Christ.\n\nIn these challenging talks, Griffith - a veteran anti-war activist who has been arrested many times for his pro-peace demonstrations - sets forth a solidly biblical argument for uncompromising nonviolence. Along the way, he describes encounters with dumpster divers and prostitutes, with bag ladies and judges, with people who hear voices and see ghosts - and he shares how, through these encounters and more, he has come to know better the subversive God of the gospel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaf6b53153cb234885385f3fe98a8cb1d3e3888b","amp;dn":"Lee+Griffith+-+God+Is+Subversive+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaf6b53153cb234885385f3fe98a8cb1d3e3888b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,246,181,49,83,203,35,72,133,56,95,63,233,138,140,177,211,227,136,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
