Then said I, Here am I; send me. When Emma Davis reads the words of Isaiah 6:8 in her room at a Georgia womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s college, she understands her true calling: to become a missionary. It is a leap of faith that sweeps her away to Africa in an odyssey of personal discovery, tremendous hardship, and profound transformation.\n\nFor the earnest, headstrong daughter of a prosperous slave owner, living among the Yoruba people is utterly unlike EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheltered childhoodÃ¢â‚¬â€as is her new husband, Henry Bowman. \n\nTwenty years her senior, the mercurial Henry is the object of EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mad first love, intensifying the sensations of all they see and share together. Each day brings new tragedy and heartbreak, and each day, Emma somehow finds the hope, passion, and strength of will to press onward. Through it all, HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first gift to Emma, a simple writing boxÃ¢â‚¬â€with its red leather-bound diary and space for a few cherished keepsakesÃ¢â‚¬â€becomes her closest confidant, EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last connection to a life that seems, in this strange new world, like a passing memory.\n\nA tale of social and spiritual awakening; a dispatch from a difficult era at home and abroad; and a meditation on faith, freedom, and desire, A Different Sun is a captivating fiction debut.\n\nGenre: Historical fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c7c929d263b42f4899b9c489fe72fab54f918b3","amp;dn":"A+Different+Sun+by+Elaine+Neil+Orr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c7c929d263b42f4899b9c489fe72fab54f918b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,124,146,157,38,59,66,244,137,155,156,72,159,231,47,171,84,249,24,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
