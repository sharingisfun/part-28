His boss is unable to fire or help him and eventually has him placed in a mental hospital. Paul Scofield (A Man for All Seasons), John McEnery (The Duellists) and Thorley Walters (TV's &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;) star in this impeccably mounted study of employment, insanity, and the rigors of everyday life from one of literature's most acclaimed geniuses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c014acf095ce8fd76b585a528b8f64e5cf99746e","amp;dn":"Bartleby++%281970%29+Original+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c014acf095ce8fd76b585a528b8f64e5cf99746e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,20,172,240,149,206,143,215,107,88,90,82,139,143,100,229,207,153,116,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
