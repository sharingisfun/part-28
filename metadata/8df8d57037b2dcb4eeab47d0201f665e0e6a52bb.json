Aired November 10, 2009 on PBS.\n\nIn &quot;Birth of Humanity,&quot; the second part of the three-part series &quot;Becoming Human,&quot; NOVA investigates the first skeleton that really looks like usÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“&quot;Turkana Boy&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“an astonishingly complete specimen of Homo erectus found by the famous Leakey team in Kenya. These early humans are thought to have developed key innovations that helped them thrive, including hunting large prey, the use of fire, and extensive social bonds.\n\nThe program examines an intriguing theory that long-distance runningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“our ability to jogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“was crucial for the survival of these early hominids. Not only did running help them escape from vicious predators roaming the grasslands, but it also gave them a unique hunting strategy: chasing down prey animals such as deer and antelope to the point of exhaustion. &quot;Birth of Humanity&quot; also probes how, why, and when humans' uniquely long period of childhood and parenting began.\n\nThe other programs in the series are Part 1: &quot;First Steps,&quot; which looks at how, for millions of years, many species of small-brained human predecessors lived, and Part 3: &quot;Last Human Standing,&quot; which examines why, of various human species that once shared the planet, only our kind remains.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 55mn 53s 153ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 028 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 121 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df8d57037b2dcb4eeab47d0201f665e0e6a52bb","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova-Becoming+Human+Part+2.S37E06.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df8d57037b2dcb4eeab47d0201f665e0e6a52bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,248,213,112,55,178,220,180,238,171,71,208,32,31,102,94,14,106,82,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
