Includes 2 acoustic tracks\nperformed by Nikola Sarcevic and Mathias FÃƒÂ¤rm.\n\n&quot;With an impressive string of releases behind them and record sales over the two\nmillion mark, Sweden?s finest MILLENCOLIN is ready to once again enter the\nstudio to record a new album. Recording is set for November-December with a\nMarch-April release. The album, still to be named, will be supported by\nworld-wide touring for a year and a half.\n\nMillencolin is a rock/punk band with roots in the Swedish skateboard and music\nscene from back in 1992. Inspired by the Californian punkrock which they grew up\nwith they formed the band. Millencolin quickly became the biggest name of the\ngenre in Sweden with their intense touring and well received debut album &quot;Tiny\nTunes&quot; (later renamed &quot;Same Old Tunes&quot; &amp;#039;94.\n\nMillencolin are now, 15 years and six albums later, Europe&amp;#039;s biggest punkband\nwith gold albums received from both Australia and Sweden. They also had a big\nhit in the USA with the song No Cigar featured on the videogame Tony Hawk Pro\nskater 2. Millencolin was also was the first band ever to get their own\nsignature shoe model - with their Millencolin Vans shoe for sale in stores world\nwide &amp;#039;03. By holding their annual skateboarding contest Millencolin Open at\ntheir indoor skatepark in Ãƒâ€“rebro, Millencolin prove that they have not forgotten\ntheir roots!\n\nLooking at things differently has helped build Millencolin into a universal\nsuccess. In their formative years as melodic punk-loving skateboard enthusiasts,\nthe group earned its musicianship and aligned with Sweden?s infamous Burning\nHeart Records. ?We really couldn?t play very well back then? Ohlsson concedes\nwith a laugh. But the foursome had will and vision, perfecting their abilities\nby the time they linked up with one of their heroes, producer Brett Gurewitz,\nguitar player of Bad Religion, for 2000?s Pennybridge Pioneers.\n\nMillencolin?s keen sense of melody, positive approach to punk and several Warped\nTour appearances behind Pennybridge earned the group legions of North American\nfans, building up the already large international profile. 2002?s mega-selling,\nmuch appreciated album Home From Home ? produced by Lou Giordano (Sugar, Goo Goo\nDolls, The Lemonheads etc) and housing hits like ?Kemp? and ?Man Or Mouse? ?\ngave way to another enormously successful touring initiative.\n\nAfter sharing stages with the likes of Blink 182, the Foo Fighters and Queens of\nthe Stone Age at festivals in Australia, Europe and the US and while reaping\nnearly two million in worldwide album sales the band returned home to write the\nnew record. Kingwood, released in 2005, was a characteristic but infectious\nalbum with Millencolin returning to their roots. The best album so far?\n\n2007, a new chapter of the Millencolin story is being written as we speak. The\nband is preparing for the upcoming recording. Summer-festivals with tremendous\nfeedback has been done. As Mathias in the band expressed himself ?Probably the\nbest shows we have ever done?. Millencolin is still one of Swedens biggest bands\nand will keep on growing, there?s no stop.\n\nAlbum, DVD &amp; EP?s\n05 - Kingwood - Album\n03 - The Hi-8 Adventures ?
