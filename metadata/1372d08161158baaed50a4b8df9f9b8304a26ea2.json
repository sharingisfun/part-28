The Gardner's youngest child, Tommy, has made a quest to free the captured Alfont from the Captors that have held them imprisoned for more than sixty million years. The Captors are hundreds of millions of years more advanced technologically than the Stars Realm Military and nothing in the Realmâ€™s arsenal can match their ships, some of which are more than three thousand miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe Captors have annihilated more than a million planets whose starships had the misfortune to stumble into their domain and Tommy is putting the Realm on a collision course with these beings that show no mercy. What the Realm doesnâ€™t know is that the Captors are coming no matter what course Tommy decides to follow. The difference maker in the coming conflict could be two Algean Adolescents that have started their education. These two will find redemption for all the destroyed worlds their race harvested and perhaps even more than redemption, each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1372d08161158baaed50a4b8df9f9b8304a26ea2","amp;dn":"Saxon+Andrew+-+Tommy%27s+Tale+%28Annihilation+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1372d08161158baaed50a4b8df9f9b8304a26ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,114,208,129,97,21,139,170,237,80,164,184,223,159,155,131,4,162,110,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
