In love with Nemo, Bombay-based Ashok Kumar goes to meet his Nairobi-based prospective father-in-law, Jamnadas (Murad). Upon entry into the hotel room, he finds his dead body, and fearing an arrest, flees, makes himself invisible, and with the help of his wealthy friend, Murli (Agha), re-locates to Rangoon, Burma. Once there, he hopes to unravel the killer(s) identity - as well as meet with his girlfriend's sister, Ragini. Little does he know that soon he will not only be taken into custody by a Private Detective, Ramesh (Sailesh Kumar) and Inspector Kundan, but also be blamed for Nemo's sudden death.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 1119 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x288\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:17:06\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: 2:17:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c50e100ded8122c679f88a7bb0a3b590b3ddd306","amp;dn":"Aadhi+Raat+Ke+Baad+%281965%29+VCD_No+Subs+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c50e100ded8122c679f88a7bb0a3b590b3ddd306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,14,16,13,237,129,34,198,121,248,138,123,176,163,181,144,179,221,211,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
