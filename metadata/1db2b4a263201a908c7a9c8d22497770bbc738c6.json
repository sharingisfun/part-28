Whether showing warmth and sentimentality on &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot; or growling and roaring on &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Ole Miss Blues,&quot; Webster (who was by then somewhat taken for granted) is in superior and creative form. Recommended. \n\n01. Caravan  \n02. Georgia On My Mind    \n03. Ole Miss Blues   \n04. What Is This Thing Called Love   \n05. Stardust  \n06. Gone With The Wind   \n07. Renaissance Blues   \n08.
