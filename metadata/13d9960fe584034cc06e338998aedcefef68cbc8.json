The series explores the camaraderie, antagonism, and friendship between the two characters. Jeph Loeb, the series' first writer, introduced a dual-narrator technique to present the characters' often opposing viewpoints and estimations of each other, which subsequent series writers have maintained. Most of the storylines are independent and self-contained from the ongoing or crossover storylines in the other Batman and Superman titles.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13d9960fe584034cc06e338998aedcefef68cbc8","amp;dn":"Superman+Batman+%281-54+%2B+Annuals%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13d9960fe584034cc06e338998aedcefef68cbc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,217,150,15,229,132,3,76,192,110,51,137,152,174,220,239,239,104,203,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
