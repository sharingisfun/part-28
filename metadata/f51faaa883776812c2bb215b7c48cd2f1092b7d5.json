It should be of interest to research scientists and thermal engineers who wish to carry out theoretical research or metrology in this field, but also to physicists concerned with the problems of heat transfer, or teachers requiring a solid foundation for an undergraduate university course in this area","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51faaa883776812c2bb215b7c48cd2f1092b7d5","amp;dn":"Microscale+and+Nanoscale+Heat+Transfer+-+Sebastian+Volz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51faaa883776812c2bb215b7c48cd2f1092b7d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,31,170,168,131,119,104,18,194,187,33,91,124,72,205,47,16,146,183,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
