Who loves us? And why? Is love really a mystery, or can neuroscience offer some answers to these age-old questions?\nIn her third enthralling book about the brain, Judith Horstman takes us on a lively tour of our most important sex and love organ and the whole smorgasbord of our many kinds of love-from the bonding of parent and child to the passion of erotic love, the affectionate love of companionship, the role of animals in our lives, and the love of God.\nDrawing on the latest neuroscience, she explores why and how we are born to love-how we're hardwired to crave the companionship of others, and how very badly things can go without love. Among the findings: parental love makes our brain bigger, sex and orgasm make it healthier, social isolation makes it miserable-and although the craving for romantic love can be described as an addiction, friendship may actually be the most important loving relationship of your life.\nBased on recent studies and articles culled from the prestigious Scientific American and Scientific American Mind magazines, The Scientific American Book of Love, Sex, and the Brain offers a fascinating look at how the brain controls our loving relationships, most intimate moments, and our deep and basic need for connection.\n\n\nPlease seed and share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3213e435e64298311e0ce1894089de2036f85f7","amp;dn":"The+Neuroscience+of+How%2C+When%2C+Why+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3213e435e64298311e0ce1894089de2036f85f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,33,62,67,94,100,41,131,17,224,206,24,148,8,157,226,3,111,133,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
