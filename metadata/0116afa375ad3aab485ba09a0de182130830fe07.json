Caputo addresses the great and classical philosophical questions as they inextricably intersect with theology--past, present, and future. Recognized as one of the leading philosophers, Caputo is peerless in introducing and initiating students into the vital relationship that philosophy and theology share together. He writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you take a long enough look, beyond the debates that divide philosophy and theology, over the walls that they have built to keep each other out or beyond the wars to subordinate one to the other, you find a common sense of awe, a common gasp of surprise or astonishment, like looking out at the endless sprawl of stars across the evening sky or upon the waves of a midnight sea.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0116afa375ad3aab485ba09a0de182130830fe07","amp;dn":"Philosophy+and+Theology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0116afa375ad3aab485ba09a0de182130830fe07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,22,175,163,117,173,58,171,72,91,160,154,13,225,130,19,8,48,254,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
