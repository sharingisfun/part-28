Patu himself describes the album as having a 'funky, R'n'B, roots reggae feel with a bit of culture'. \n\nOn listening to the CD, similarities can immediately be drawn to other Aotearoa roots outfits.   There is a definite Katchafire/House of Shem feel, with some of the more indigenous flavours from foundation rockers Herbs.  1814's sound will appeal to those who favour this homegrown reggae music with Jah Rydem having a balance of easy listening pop reggae styles with bass driven conscious tunes.  Personal highlights include the tracks Let My People Go and the upbeat Get Up.
