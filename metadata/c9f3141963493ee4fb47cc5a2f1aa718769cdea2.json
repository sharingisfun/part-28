The victim's brother, Conway D'Innocenzio, is a 29-year-old Brooklynite wasting away at a local Rite Aid, stuck in the past and still howling for Ray Boy's blood. \n\nWhen the chips are down and the gun is drawn, Conway finds that he doesn't have murder in him. Thus begins a spiral of self-loathing and soul-searching into which he is joined by Alessandra, a failed actress caring for her widowed father, and Eugene, Ray Boy's hellbound nephew. Ray Boy Calabrese is back in Gravesend: some people worship him, some want him dead . . . but none more so than the ex-con himself.\n\nGenre: Mystery | Noir ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f3141963493ee4fb47cc5a2f1aa718769cdea2","amp;dn":"Gravesend+by+William+Boyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f3141963493ee4fb47cc5a2f1aa718769cdea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,243,20,25,99,73,62,228,251,71,204,90,47,26,167,24,118,156,222,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
