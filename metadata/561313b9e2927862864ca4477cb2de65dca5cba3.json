She worked with veteran Miami\nsoul musicians Benny Latimore, Little Beaver, Timmy Thomas, and Wright herself.\nShe also worked with contemporary musicians such as neo soul singer Angie\nStone and the alternative hip hop group The Roots.\n\nStone told MTV News that she felt intimidated by the credentials of the musicians\nthat worked on the album. &quot;It was weird because they've worked with so many\ngreat, great singers I'm talking the best. I kind of walked in, just like this little girl\nand started singing.&quot; By the end of the session, she had impressed everybody with\nher talent..[/b][/color]\n\n\n\n   [color=maroon][b]1.
