At the heart of the novel is Giovanna, whose family is targeted by the notorious Black Hand--the precursor to the Mafia.\n\nElizabeth Street brings to light a period in history when Italian immigrant neighborhoods lived in fear of Black Hand extortion and violence--a reality that defies the romanticized depiction of the Mafia.\n\nHere, the author reveals the merciless terror of the Black Hand-and the impact their crimes had on her family. Giovanna is based on Fabiano's great-grandmother, and the book's heroes and villains - such as Lieutenant Petrosino, the crusading cop and &quot;Lupo the Wolf,&quot; a cold-blooded criminal - are drawn from real life in this thrilling tale. While set in a dynamic historical context, Elizabeth Street is, above all, the dramatic story of the heroine, Giovanna, and how she triumphed over tragedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c95231e8be11d777fe7e44bfba50f98ed482ca","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+Street+by+Laurie+Fabiano+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c95231e8be11d777fe7e44bfba50f98ed482ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,201,82,49,232,190,17,215,119,254,126,68,191,186,80,249,142,212,130,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
