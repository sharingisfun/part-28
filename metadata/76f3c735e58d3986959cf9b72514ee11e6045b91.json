What is novel is the readiness of some of the party's grandest grandees to call for a British exit. Stephen Sackur talks to Lord Lawson, Margaret Thatcher's former Chancellor, who recently labelled the EU a bureaucratic monstrosity, past its sell-by-date. His intervention embarrassed prime minister David Cameron and deepened the impression of a Tory party dangerously divided. So, why did he do it?\n\n\nInterviewed Guest: Lord Lawson\nPresenter        : Stephen Sackur\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02vl3x0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02vl3x0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f3c735e58d3986959cf9b72514ee11e6045b91","amp;dn":"BBC+HARDtalk+-+06-10-2013+-+Lord+Lawson+-+Former+UK+Chancellor+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f3c735e58d3986959cf9b72514ee11e6045b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,243,199,53,229,141,57,134,149,156,249,183,37,20,238,17,230,4,91,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
