Frank Baum and illustrated by W.W. Denslow. It was originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago in 1900,[1] and has since been reprinted countless times, most often under the name The Wizard of Oz, which is the name of both the 1902 stage play and the extremely popular, highly acclaimed 1939 film version. The story chronicles the adventures of a girl named Dorothy in the Land of Oz. Thanks in part to the 1939 MGM movie, it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture and has been widely translated. Its initial success, and the success of the popular 1902 Broadway musical Baum adapted from his story, led to Baum's writing and having published thirteen more Oz books.\n\nThis Audiobook is in the Public Domain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59bcd88c25630333ad752239c5ccb88ab8ad4377","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+The+Wizard+of+Oz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59bcd88c25630333ad752239c5ccb88ab8ad4377","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,188,216,140,37,99,3,51,173,117,34,57,197,204,184,138,184,173,67,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
