The brainchild of Paul Rose aka Scuba, or more recently SCB, Hotflush and sublabels Scuba and Abucs figured prominently in the development of the Dubstep sound. On the virtue of ScubaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s releases alone, the Hotflush legacy is undeniable, but in providing a platform for the earliest endeavors of such scene leading artists as Shackleton, Vaccine, Boxcutter, and Distance, Hotflush solidified itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reputation as an instrumental force continually pushing the artistic frontiers of the scene. On the periphery though, all was not roses. Amidst a series of rumored A&amp;R setbacks, frustrations with his London lifestyle and the direction of Dubstep in particular, Rose shifted his base of operations to Berlin and somewhat awkwardly rebooted the entire label as Hotflush Two, in the process unleashing a dramatic change-up in the sound that echoes into the present. In Berlin, Rose took over Techno temple Berghain for the SUB:STANCE series of events, bringing Techno, Drum and Bass, and Dubstep together for a subwoofer-shuddering soundclash that reverberated across all 3 genres. The effect, while at first slagged off by the Dubstep purists, eventually dragged the Bass world into the afterhours Techno void where it has taken on new shape and found a new, wider audience.  Now sporting a stellar full-length under his own Scuba name and a string of genre-defying and genre-defining releases on his labels, Paul Rose has a resume few can match as his label rolls into its justly-celebrated anniversary.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n1.
