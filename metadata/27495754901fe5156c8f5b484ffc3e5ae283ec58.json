This was confirmed at the final date of the Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys Tour in San Francisco, when stickers advertising the band and the website were passed out promoting April 2011. Eventually, the project was titled the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, and a two months California tour was launched on March 29, 2011 in Santa Barbara, California. The Chris Robinson Brotherhood lineup includes Adam MacDougall (of the Black Crowes) on keyboards, George Sluppick on drums, Mark &quot;Muddy&quot; Dutton (of Burning Tree) on Bass, and Neal Casal on guitar. Casal replaced Jonathan Wilson, who was initially announced as a member of the band, but left shortly after.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27495754901fe5156c8f5b484ffc3e5ae283ec58","amp;dn":"Chris+Robinson+Brotherhood+-+LIVE+04%2F28%2F2011+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27495754901fe5156c8f5b484ffc3e5ae283ec58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,73,87,84,144,31,229,21,108,143,91,72,79,252,62,90,226,131,236,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
