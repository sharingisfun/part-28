The band consisted of Gibbons on guitar, Don Summers on bass, Dan Mitchell on drums and Tom Moore on keyboards.\n\nGibbons founded the Texas psychedelic group in the mid-1960s and quickly drew a large following, especially in the Houston &quot;teen scene&quot;. They recorded several singles and one full-length album, Flash. Their single &quot;99th Floor&quot; was a hit and topped the charts at #1 in Houston for six weeks. The success of this record led the Sidewalks to sign with Wand Records which then released &quot;Need Me&quot; which also became a Top 10 Hit. The group was asked to open for many legendary rock tours, including Jimi Hendrix and The Doors.\n\nAfter Tom Moore and Don Summers were drafted into the U.S. Army, Billy Gibbons and Dan Mitchell added Lanier Greig and formed the original ZZ Top. They recorded the first ZZ Top record, &quot;Salt Lick&quot;, which was released on London Records.\n\nThe Moving Sidewalks opened for the legendary Texas psychedelic group 13th Floor Elevators at the Houston, Texas psychedelic venue Love Street Emporium located on Commerce Street on the edge of downtown Houston. The Elevators set was stopped after only a few songs by the Houston police department who arrested the band's lead singer Roky Erickson.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Sidewalks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Sidewalks&lt;/a&gt;   128kbps\n\n   1. &quot;Flashback&quot;\n   2. &quot;Scoun Da Be&quot;\n   3. &quot;You Make Me Shake&quot;\n   4. &quot;You Don't Know the Life&quot;\n   5. &quot;Pluto - Sept 31st&quot;\n   6. &quot;No Good to Cry&quot;\n   7. &quot;Crimson Witch&quot;\n   8. &quot;Joe Blues&quot;\n   9. &quot;Eclipse&quot;\n  10. &quot;Reclipse&quot;\n  11. &quot;99th Floor&quot;\n  12. &quot;What Are You Doing to Do&quot;\n  13. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;\n  14. &quot;Need Me&quot;\n  15. &quot;Every Night a New Surprise&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683772dbea3385680c48d5d97add9e7ea3428092","amp;dn":"Moving+Sidewalks+-+Flash+-+1968+Billy+Gibbons+pre+ZZ+Top","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683772dbea3385680c48d5d97add9e7ea3428092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,55,114,219,234,51,133,104,12,72,213,217,122,221,158,126,163,66,128,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
