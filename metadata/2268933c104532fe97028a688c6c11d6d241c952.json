It  is   \n         compatible with all Windows versions and lets you control   \n         which users are allowed to  access your PC  and the level   \n         of access each user may have.  You can  choose  to  tweak   \n         access   to  lots  of Control   Panel  applet  functions,   \n         including Display, Network, Passwords, Printers,  System,   \n         Add/Remove Programs,  etc.  You  can enforce users to use   \n         separate system profile   folders  and provide them  with   \n         their own  custom  shell  folders such  as Desktop, Start   \n         Menu, Favorites, My Documents. Additionally, by tweaking,   \n         you  can: disable selected  Start Menu items,  lock   and   \n         protect  disk  drives in My Computer, disable the DOS and   \n         command  prompt,  interruption  boot keys, real DOS mode,   \n         Registry editing,  taskbar,  task   manager,  and network   \n         access, hide  desktop icons,   and  much   more.  You can   \n         password-protect  Windows  and restrict users  to running   \n         specific   applications  only.   Security  tweaks  can be   \n         applied  universally  or  just   to  specific users. This   \n         software also lets you tweak Internet Explorer to  secure   \n         web browsing.                                               \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n         Installation:                                               \n                                                                     \n         Install the application and use the keygen to register...   \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                                                                 \n                                                                \n                                         \n                             \n                       \n                        \n                                                                     \n          We are the unfaithful ones, the aggressive ones, the       \n          ones you don't want to trust - we are ROGUE!               \n                                                                     \n          We are looking for:                                        \n          * Experienced keygenners...                                \n          * Experienced unpackers...                                 \n          * Experienced suppliers...                                 \n                                                                     \n          We are not looking for:                                    \n          * New sites...                                             \n          * YOU!                                                     \n                                                                   \n         Contact us at:                                            \n           ...find us!                                             \n                                                                   \n                                                                 \n                                                                \n                                         \n                                \n                     \n                        \n                                                                     \n          Greetings go out to...                                     \n                                                                   \n         ...to all of our friends out there!                       \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                                                                 \n                                                                \n                                           \n                               \n                              \n      ASCII               X/BbH\n                          \n                T.E.A.M...R.O.G.U.E...2.0.0.9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2268933c104532fe97028a688c6c11d6d241c952","amp;dn":"PC.Security.Tweaker.v9.3.Incl.Keymaker.and.Patch-ROGUE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2268933c104532fe97028a688c6c11d6d241c952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,104,147,60,16,69,50,254,151,2,138,104,140,108,17,214,210,65,201,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
