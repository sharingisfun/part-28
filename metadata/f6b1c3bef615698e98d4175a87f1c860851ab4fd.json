And so the mighty Panzer regiments thundered into action - killing, raping, burning their way across the great wastes of Russia... But this was to be the bloodiest of all Hitler's wars - a war where Russian infantrymen threw themselves before the oncoming tanks, where women fought as savagely as men, where German guns killed Germans and Russians alike, mangling them indiscriminately into tattered hunks of meat. And finally Porta, Tiny, Barcelona, all of them - caring nothing for who should win the war - thinking only of their own survival - began the long retreat - back through the corpse-littered plains where blood and bodies were already frozen beneath the winter ice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b1c3bef615698e98d4175a87f1c860851ab4fd","amp;dn":"Blitzfreeze+-+Hassel+Sven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b1c3bef615698e98d4175a87f1c860851ab4fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,177,195,190,246,21,105,142,152,212,23,90,135,241,200,96,133,26,180,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
