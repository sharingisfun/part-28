Contain extensive historical materials and innumerable allusions to the geographical background of that history\n\n\n\nThe geographical references range eastward to the Tigris and Euphrates and beyond to Media, Elam, and Parthia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from which came some of those present at Pentecost ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and even to India. Including Asia Minor, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Arabia, they reach westward beyond Greece and Rome as far as Spain, which Paul visited or hoped to visit, and where we are probably to find Tarshish, towards which Jonah started his fateful voyage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c560bde329e7238b2bb0cfc9a9880b8b4d5912ea","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Atlas+by+Zaine+Ridling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c560bde329e7238b2bb0cfc9a9880b8b4d5912ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,96,189,227,41,231,35,139,43,176,207,201,169,136,11,139,77,89,18,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
