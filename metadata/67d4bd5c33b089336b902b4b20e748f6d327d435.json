Most are CD quality, except for #7 A Finer End which is still only available on cassette tapes.\nHalf of these titles are recorded at 32 kbps / 22 kHz Mono CBR Fraunhofer. The other half are 48 kbps / 44 kHz Mono CBR.\nMost are narrated by either Michael Deehy or Jenny Sterlin.\n\n\n\nDeborah Crombie just might be the most British of the American mystery novelists in her excellent UK based crime series featuring Duncan Kincaid, an inoffensively upper-class Scotland Yard superintendent, and Sergeant Gemma James, his rougher-edged partner. In addition to her finely tuned ear for the subtler nuances of Britspeak, Crombie achieves a rare balance between the details of her characters' private lives and the plot of each particular book.
