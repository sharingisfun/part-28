But Jack is quickly pressed into duty after a call from his client Sherman Wilkerson, asking Jack to track down his young granddaughter who is on the run from a brutal drug dealer.\r\n\r\nBefore Jack can locate her, several members of France's cultural elite are found dead--murdered in stunning, symbolic fashion. The only link between the crimes is a mysterious graffiti tag. As religious and ethnic tensions simmer in the City of Lights, only Jack and his Private team can connect the dots before the smoldering powder keg explodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:305be32796035e2f45871774c185eaa6c5463dac","amp;dn":"Private+Paris+%5BAudiobook%5D+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"305be32796035e2f45871774c185eaa6c5463dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,91,227,39,150,3,94,47,69,135,23,116,193,133,234,166,197,70,61,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
