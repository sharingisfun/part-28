The second time I ran it, everything was fine. In short, be prepared for nostalgia bliss and frustration headaches. Remember to run in Windows 95 compatibility mode!\n\nPersonal note: this ISO is ripped from a physical CD I actually possess. It was packaged with the first PC my family bought, and it was the first computer game I played. Ah, memories.\n\n\n\nUpload generously!
