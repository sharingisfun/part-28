Challenges will arise though as the ship comes into range of Stargates placed centuries ahead of the Destiny and the crew is unable to control the ship's navigational schedule. If someone is left behind, there is no way to go back for them, adding to the drama of encountering new races, enemies and adventures. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i230.photobucket.com/albums/ee130/Hengelen/dutchman.gif[/IMG]\n\nUploaded for: www.hetmultimediacafe.nl\nPls visit the site if you want quality movie reviews and more.\n\nSubs by: www.Bierdopje.com\nMy gratitude for their hard work.\n\nEnjoy the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5281ebb1e431a7d02e34bb144735a7c79a4807c","amp;dn":"Stargate+Universe+-+The+complete+Series+1+-+Hardcoded+Dutch+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5281ebb1e431a7d02e34bb144735a7c79a4807c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,40,30,187,30,67,26,125,2,227,75,177,68,115,90,124,121,164,128,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
