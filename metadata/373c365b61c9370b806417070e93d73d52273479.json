W.

Dum-Dum Dugan \n\nand Countess Valentina brief Kitty on the situation, and she set to work, partnered with AI \n\nspecialist intern Rigby Fallon.  Before they get very far, Ogun reveals himself as the entity \n\nbehind the out of control computers; his recent possession of Lady Deathstrike has taught him how \n\nto infect circuitry.\n\nOgun then causes the Helicarrier to drift dangerously through Manhattan, and, imitating Kitty, \n\nphones Wolverine to come to her aid, and into his trap.\n\nMore adventures of Kitty Pryde:\n\nKitty Pryde and Wolverine #1-6 (1984-1985) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5045008/Kitty_Pryde_and_Wolverine_(Marvel)_(1984_series__001-006)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5045008/Kitty_Pryde_and_Wolverine_(Marvel)_(1984_series__001-006)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373c365b61c9370b806417070e93d73d52273479","amp;dn":"Kitty+Pryde%2C+Agent+of+S.H.I.E.L.D.+%231-3+%281997-1998%29+%5BMarvel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373c365b61c9370b806417070e93d73d52273479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,60,54,91,97,201,55,11,128,100,23,7,14,147,215,61,82,39,52,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
