Unwilling to be solely reliant upon imported technology, particularly from the U.S., British engineers sought to ensure that Britain remained an independent and viable force in aviation. However, economic reality soon set in. The 1957 Defense White Paper produced by the Conservative government has long been viewed as the catalyst for the major cull of the UK aviation industry that soon came about. In truth, this was but a single event in an ongoing process that saw many promising projects foundering due to changes in threats, technology, and economic realities.\n The fourth volume in the 'British Secret Projects' series shows how the hopes of the time failed to see fulfillment. Following a scene-setting introduction, chapters will deal with test vehicles and guided weapons. This includes those developed for air defense, ballistic missile defense, anti-tank weapons, anti-ship ordnance, and stand-off weapons. The book also covers the so-called 'Super Bloodhound' surface-to-air guided weapon, a ramjet-powered development which was designated Blue Envoy. Also included are ramjet-powered projects like the Hawker P.1134 high-speed research aircraft, the English Electric/BAC P.42 and HSA APD.1019 proposals, and the HS.1034 swing-wing strike fighter.\n\nAmazon.com book link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/British-Secret-Projects-Hypersonics-Missiles/dp/1857802586&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/British-Secret-Projects-Hypersonics-Missiles/dp/1857802586&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ac93775541cf2ad7fc5488eb9047802169edac","amp;dn":"British+Secret+Projects%3A+Hypersonics%2C+Ramjets+and+Missiles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ac93775541cf2ad7fc5488eb9047802169edac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,172,147,119,85,65,207,42,215,252,84,136,235,144,71,128,33,105,237,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
