Here is the story...\n\nBack in the prehistoric days, before torrents and FTP, was this thing called &quot;trading CD's thru the mail.&quot; One of the guys who\nI traded with said he had something very special if I'd like to hear it, on the condition that I never trade it until he said it was OK to.\nHe sent me this! Someone who had access to the CD recorded it and made a copy for himself and a friend. That friend made me a copy,\nwhich is where these files were extracted from.\n\nNow, I dated this really strange chick for a while after meeting her one night after a gig in Luxembourg. Many of you know her as Rosie Lee.\nShe was in a band called the Fluffernutter Devices and was a HUGE fan of the VU. She asked if she could have a copy of this disc, so I\nconverted it so she could play it on her portable player on her band's van. It was this lossy copy that made it onto the site a while back\nand it was from these lossy tracks that Nothing Songs put out one of their bullshite compilations.\n\n(I'd like to point out that quite some time ago, just before I met Rosie actually, the person who provided me this disk stated that it was OK\nto circulate it.)\n\nSo, anyone who purchased the Nothing Songs set containing these tracks is actually listening to MP3's converted to MP4's. I saw some idiot\npaid over $100 on ePay for a bootleg of these tracks. What an idiot!\n\nAnyways, here ya go. As far as my VU &quot;vaults&quot; are concerned, this is it. I have nothing else to give the community. For anyone who is\nhiding recordings deep in their basement, why not share the wealth? What good is a recording if you are the only person who can enjoy it?\nWhy not share it and let hundreds of other people hum along with you?!\n\nOriginally uploaded by MG196\nReuploaded by Roofvogel to www.velvetunderground.be","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7050269614b5bc2325f44c19f2aa964a5945f520","amp;dn":"The+Velvet+Underground+-+All+Tomorrow%5C%27s+Parties+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7050269614b5bc2325f44c19f2aa964a5945f520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,80,38,150,20,181,188,35,37,244,76,25,242,170,150,74,89,69,245,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
