From there, she went on to fill many LPs with her winningly hesitant, longing vocal style - this disc collects 25 tracks cut between 1965 and 1970 for Verve. Among them are early versions of a number of Brazilian standards by the likes of Antonio Carlos Jobim ('How Insensitive,' 'Once I Loved') and Luiz Bonfa ('The Gentle Rain,' 'Tristeza'). 'Fly Me to the Moon' and the Bricusse-Newley 'Who Can I Turn To' fit the mood perfectly. Throughout, Gilberto is aided by lush, thoughtful arrangements, including one by Gil Evans on 'Berimbou.' This entry in the Silver Collection series is an excellent introduction to one of Brazilian pop's most emblematic voices.\n(Rickey Wright, amazon.com)\n\nWith her simultaneously childlike and alluring voice and vibrato-less 'desafinado' (deliberately slightly off-pitch) singing style, Gilberto is one of the most unique and unforgettable singers in the history of jazz. Split evenly between Portuguese-language sambas, many written by the great Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, and bossa nova-style interpretations of such jazz standards and pop tunes as 'The Shadow Of Your Smile' and 'Dreamer,' all 25 tracks on this hour-long CD are '60s jazz-pop classics.\n\n- - -\n\nAstrud Gilberto - The Silver Collection 1965-1970\n(New York Verve Records 1991)\n\n 1.
