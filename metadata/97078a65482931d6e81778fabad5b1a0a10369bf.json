It is the complex dynamics of flow that structures our atmosphere, land, and oceans.Part of a trilogy of books exploring the science of patterns in nature by acclaimed science writer Philip Ball, this volume explores the elusive rules that govern flow - the science of chaotic behavior.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97078a65482931d6e81778fabad5b1a0a10369bf","amp;dn":"Flow+-+Natures+Patterns%2C+A+Tapestry+in+Three+Parts+%28Nature+Art%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97078a65482931d6e81778fabad5b1a0a10369bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,7,138,101,72,41,49,214,232,23,120,250,186,213,177,160,161,3,105,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
