The seven apprentice gold-diggers, who have no real idea of what awaits them, leave the town of Ashcroft, the end of the railway line and set off for their long journey. As they sink into the wilderness of Canada's wide-open paces, fatigue is felt. Worse, the maps become uncertain. As a result, doubt sets in and conflicts burst forth.\n\n\nLanguages: German / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8985f0c922fc38d70323a3ae7435b8008edd3296","amp;dn":"Gold+2013+BRRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8985f0c922fc38d70323a3ae7435b8008edd3296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,133,240,201,34,252,56,215,3,35,163,174,116,53,184,0,142,221,50,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
