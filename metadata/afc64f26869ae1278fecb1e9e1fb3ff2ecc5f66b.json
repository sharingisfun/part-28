In eight days they will come for\nher. In eight days, what Jane fears the most\nwill become a reality. In eight days, she will\ndie. It all begins with a painting that Jane,\nan artist, displays in her Parisian gallery.\nThe painting is called &quot;Guilt&quot; and Jane has no\nidea how or why she painted the portrait of\nthe chilling face. But the members of a cult\nthat dates back to the time of Christ believe\nthat Jane's blasphemy means she must die. But\nfirst, she will lead them to an ancient\ntreasure whose value is beyond price. This\nelusive treasure, and Jane's death, are all\nthat they need for their power to come to\nultimate fruition. With Eve's help, can Jane\nescape before the clock stops ticking?\n\nEight Days To Live (Eve Duncan #10)\nBy Iris Johansen\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 636","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc64f26869ae1278fecb1e9e1fb3ff2ecc5f66b","amp;dn":"Eight+Days+To+Live+%28Eve+Duncan+%2310%29++by+Iris+Johansen+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc64f26869ae1278fecb1e9e1fb3ff2ecc5f66b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,198,79,38,134,154,225,39,143,236,177,233,225,251,63,242,236,197,246,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
