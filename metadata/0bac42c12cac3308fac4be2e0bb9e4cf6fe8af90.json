The ZDF - Hitparade, or Hitparade for short, was one of the most popular and most well-known music television series by German TV channel ZDF. \n\nIt was developed by Truck Branss and Dieter Thomas Heck and first broadcast on January 18, 1969. Subsequent hosts of the Hitparade were Viktor Worms (1985-1990) and Uwe Hubner (1990-2000). The last episode aired on December 16, 2000.\n\nThe rule was that each singer had to present his or her song live (to music from half-playback). Earlier musical TV-shows had already switched to full-playback. Also, with the exception of the pilot, each episode was live, which also was unusual. \n\nThe most important innovation introduced by Dieter Thomas Heck was that the audience members had the chance to assert influence in the choice of musical artists. The viewers could select their favorite acts by postcard. \n\n&quot;99 Luftballons&quot; is a protest song by the German singer Nena. &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; reached #1 in West Germany in 1983. In 1984, the original German version also peaked at #2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart and the English-language version topped the UK Singles Chart. The German version topped the Australian charts for five weeks and the New Zealand charts for one week. \n\nThe translation of the title is sometimes given as &quot;Ninety-Nine Air Balloons&quot;, however &quot;Ninety-Nine Balloons&quot; is also correct. A Luftballon is a colourful toy balloon, rather than a balloon for transport or research. \n(video has a white semi-transparent &quot;2DF&quot; logo at the top left)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Luftballons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Luftballons&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDF-Hitparade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDF-Hitparade&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caaMmAAdl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caaMmAAdl&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:49\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
