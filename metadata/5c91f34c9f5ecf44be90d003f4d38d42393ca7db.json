The other four numbers feature vibraphonist David Friedman in a quartet with Silver, Cranshaw and Roker, a very unusual sound for a Horace Silver set. \nBut no matter what the instrumentation, the style is pure Silver, hard-driving and melodic hard bop with a strong dose of funky soul. (AMG)\n\n\n\nI've always been partial to Horace's 70s output, work that combines fresh presentations with more adventurous harmonics. While kind of a forgotten record (stuck in that bad-old late 60's jazz limbo) this CD is a great example of how Horace stretched himself, and the receptive listener too.\nFeaturing five fresh Silver compositions and two imports that he easily made his own, the key tonal difference here is the presence of Friedman's vibes on four cuts. &quot;Summer&quot;, a rare Silver waltz, glistens with beautiful warm-weather chords, while &quot;Strange Vibes&quot; lays down a mean misterioso groove. The fast-mambo title cut drives with incredible momentum, alternating Latin and swing.\nThe quintet cuts are a little more conventional Horace. The Irvine cut is a joyous Latin number, a great way to kick off the disc, while &quot;Nothing&quot; is straight down the middle of the Horace fairway. &quot;Gregory&quot;, after his new-born son, is simply one of the 4 or 5 greatest Horace Silver compositions of all time, inventive, exciting (Latin again) and rewarding.
