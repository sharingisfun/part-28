His symphonies and string quartets are mainstays of the repertoire.\n\nBut Shostakovich is also a figure whose story raises challenging and exciting issues that go far beyond music: They touch on questions of conscience, of the moral role of the artist, of the plight of humanity in the face of total war and mass oppression, and of the inner life of history's bloodiest century. \n\n\n8 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture\n\n1    Let the Controversy Begin \n2    The Kid's Got Talent! \n3    Lady Macbeth \n4    Resurrection \n5    The Great Patriotic War \n6    Repression and Depression \n7    The Thaw \n8    Illness and Inspiration ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89a9de82ba0af271662e5ac659af1d2c39ebd0eb","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Great+Masters+-+Shostakovich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89a9de82ba0af271662e5ac659af1d2c39ebd0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,169,222,130,186,10,242,113,102,46,90,198,89,175,29,44,57,235,208,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
