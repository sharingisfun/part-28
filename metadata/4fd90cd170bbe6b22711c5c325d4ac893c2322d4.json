Ika Musume, It was fun making a song about such a wonderfully weird and innocent anime. Then getting a bunch of non-otakus to remix it.

I DON'T DO IT FOR YOU, BUT YOU MAKE ALOT MORE WORTH WHILE! 8====D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd90cd170bbe6b22711c5c325d4ac893c2322d4","amp;dn":"Tooth+Eye+-+Blood+Is+An+Open+Cage+%28breakcore%2C+hardcore%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd90cd170bbe6b22711c5c325d4ac893c2322d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,217,12,209,112,187,230,178,39,17,197,195,37,212,172,137,60,35,34,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
