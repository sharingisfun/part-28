Contrary to their previous album, which featured a much more hard rock sound, this album was the first to showcase the progressive rock sound that the band has become renowned for. This release was also the first to feature long-time drummer Neil Peart.\r\n\r\n\r\nFly by Night was recorded at Toronto Sound Studios on Overlea Boulevard in Toronto. Rush also recorded parts of their first album at the same studio. Since the first album sessions, the studio had upgraded its equipment from a Cadac console with an Ampex MM-1000 two-inch 16-track and a MM-1000 8-track, to a two-inch analogue 24-track master tape recorder. Pictures shown on the album artwork indicate that the studio used a 24-track recorder made by Studer and a Neve mixing console, a combination that was widely considered to be state-of-the-art by audio engineers. These were the preferred brands by many top studios worldwide up through the mid-1990s when digital recording equipment became the standard. Fly by Night is the band's first album to be produced by Terry Brown, who had remixed the band's debut album. Brown would maintain this role through 1982's Signals. The high fidelity recording of Fly by Night helped move the band forward in a direction that piqued the interest of audiophiles, who would seek out this type of recording while also getting familiar with the band's material. It set an early standard of excellence in this area not often prioritized by the harder rock bands of the mid-1970s rock era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n\r\n1. &quot;Anthem&quot;   Neil Peart Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson 4:26 \r\n2. &quot;Best I Can&quot;   Geddy Lee Geddy Lee 3:24 \r\n3. &quot;Beneath, Between &amp; Behind&quot;   Neil Peart Alex Lifeson 3:00 \r\n4. &quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog I: At the Tobes of Hades 8:39\r\n5. &quot;Fly by Night&quot;   Neil Peart Geddy Lee 3:20 \r\n6. &quot;Making Memories&quot;   Neil Peart Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson 2:56 \r\n7. &quot;Rivendell&quot;   Neil Peart Geddy Lee 5:00 \r\n8. &quot;In the End&quot;   Geddy Lee Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson 6:51 \r\n\r\nTOTAL TIME: 37:54\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONNEL:\r\n\r\nGeddy Lee â€“ lead vocals, bass guitar, classical guitar\r\nAlex Lifeson â€“ guitars\r\nNeil Peart â€“ drums, percussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReality Ascent by Dragan Glavasic\r\nWAKE UP!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4:58 AM 8/24/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3856642cd4f762ba42579a8273363a25f355a64d","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Fly+By+Night+%5BSHM-CD%5D+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3856642cd4f762ba42579a8273363a25f355a64d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,86,100,44,212,247,98,186,66,87,154,130,115,54,58,37,243,85,166,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
