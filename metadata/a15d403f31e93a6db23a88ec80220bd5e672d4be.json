The show is co-hosted by former MTV VJ Lisa Kennedy Montgomery, Reason Magazine editor Matt Welch, and chairman of America's Future Foundation, Kmele Foster.\n\nSeed and enjoy! Spread it like the brushfires of freedom!\n\n(Despite the fact that it is horribly inappropriate, Kennedy's spontaneous laughter during one point in the show is probably the most hilarious moment she has provided yet. I keep playing it back, and yes, it is still just as funny.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a15d403f31e93a6db23a88ec80220bd5e672d4be","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.02.04.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a15d403f31e93a6db23a88ec80220bd5e672d4be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,93,64,63,49,233,58,109,178,58,136,236,128,34,11,213,230,114,212,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
