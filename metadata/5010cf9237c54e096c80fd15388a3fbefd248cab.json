In a series of 500 nearly wordless, highly informative step-by-step procedurals, readers learn how to do hundreds of useful (and fascinating and important and sometimes downright bizarre) tasks, including: Perform CPR, dance the tango, pack a suitcase, win a bar bet, play the blues, make authentic sushi rolls, fight a shark . . . and 493 more essentials of modern life. Packed with useful hands-on reference material, Show Me How is a work of art that just happens to also be an indispensable real-life resource.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5010cf9237c54e096c80fd15388a3fbefd248cab","amp;dn":"Show+Me+How%3A+500+Things+You+Should+Know+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5010cf9237c54e096c80fd15388a3fbefd248cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,16,207,146,55,197,78,9,108,128,253,21,56,138,63,190,253,36,140,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
