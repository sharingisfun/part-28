Both artists are accomplished professionals and it shows on this pairing.  \n\nEllis has played with the likes of Ella, Oscar Peterson and Ben Webster to name but a few.  Tompkins, the Tonight Show pianist for \n\nnearly 10 years has also played with Benny Goodman in the late 50's.  There's a few old standards here that you may recognize \n\nand a few new tunes that may become standards over time.  A nice cover photo and informative liner notes complete the package.&quot;\n \nPersonnel:\nHerb Ellis: guitar\nRoss Tompkins: piano\n \nHerb Ellis &amp; Ross Tompkins - A Pair To Draw To TrackS;\nSide A\n01  They Didn't Believe Me (Jerome Kern / Herbert Reynolds) 3:24\n02  Here's That Rainy Day (Johnny Burke / James Van Heusen) 3:35\n03  Someday My Prince Will Come (Frank Churchill / Larry Morey) 4:48\n04  You and the Night and the Music (Howard Dietz / Arthur Schwartz) 4:37\n05  A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (Eric Maschwitz / Manning Sherwin) 3:41\n\nSide B\n01  You Stepped Out of a Dream (Nacio Herb Brown / Gus Kahn) 4:45\n02  A Child Is Born (Thad Jones) 3:23\n03  Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most (Tommy Wolf / Fran Landesman) 5:57\n04  The More I See You (Mack Gordon / Harry Warren) 4:47\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065c072565d53a6dbabdac552b161071350bb097","amp;dn":"Herb+Ellis+%26+Ross+Tompkins+-+A+Pair+To+Draw+To+%281976%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bfla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065c072565d53a6dbabdac552b161071350bb097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,92,7,37,101,213,58,109,186,189,172,85,43,22,16,113,53,11,176,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
