Throughout their career they consisted of up to 50 members (many of whom were also standing members of MFSB â€“ Philadelphia Internationals house band). They released eleven successful albums on Salsoul Records over a seven year period.\r\n\r\nBBR are delighted to release an expanded re-master of THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA, their debut LP from 1975. The album features the amazing singles â€˜Salsoul Hustleâ€™ (R&amp;B #44/Pop #76), â€˜Tangerineâ€™ (R&amp;B #36/Pop #18) and â€˜Youâ€™re Just The Right Sizeâ€™ (R&amp;B #76/Pop #88) which also featured â€˜Chicago Bus Stop (Ooh I Love It)â€™ as a B-side. The track went on to be regarded as a Dance classic.\r\nBBR is delighted to launch our extensive program of expanded CD re-masters from the legendary SALSOUL label. These in demand titles have been out of print for almost two decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
