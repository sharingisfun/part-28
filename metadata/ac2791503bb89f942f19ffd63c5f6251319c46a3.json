More than spice travels your\n  roads - musket armies, philosophies, and power plays that span the globe are\n  at your control. From palace to monastry, trade post to smugglers den - your\n  town is worthless without the nobles, monks, merchants and rogues that chose\n  to live in it - and keeping them all happy at the same time is never simple.\n \n  Features:\n  ~~~~~~~~~\n  - Advanced economic and trading simulation. 3 tiers of industry provide\n    goods and services for populations of citizens, slaves and nobles with\n    full control over wages and taxation.\n  - Build a network of farms, mines and caravan routes. Scout the map to find\n    rare and exotic goods to export to distant lands.\n  - Defeat Bandit raiders, or pay them tribute to keep your routes peaceful.\n  - Compete against cunning corporate rivals. Choose diplomacy or raid their\n    caravans and wage war on their cities.\n  - Meet your citizen's social and religious needs. Attract visiting\n    explorers or pilgrims by developing the entertainment or spiritual side of\n    your town.\n \n  URL: http://www.aartformgames.com/games/spice-road\n  URL: http://www.desura.com/games/spice-road\n  URL:\n \n  - Unzip and unrar\n  - Run 'SpiceRoadSetup1.002.exe' to install the game\n  - Install required redistributables if necessary\n  - Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2791503bb89f942f19ffd63c5f6251319c46a3","amp;dn":"Spice+Road+v1.002-FAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2791503bb89f942f19ffd63c5f6251319c46a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,39,145,80,59,184,159,148,47,25,255,214,60,95,98,81,49,156,70,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
