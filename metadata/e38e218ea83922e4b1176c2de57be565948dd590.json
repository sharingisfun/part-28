Its aim is to illuminate serious issues in new and unusual ways. It gets to the heart of contemporary domestic issues and turns them upside down and inside out. \n\nTo be circumcised or not to be circumcised? That is the question and Mischief goes looking for the answer. Most American men are circumcised, whereas Brits prefer to keep their foreskin intact. So is it better to be circumcised or not? Is it healthier? Sexier? Or are circumcised men and their lovers missing out? \n\nAssistant Producer/Camera: Michael Ogden \nProducer/Director: Christopher Sykes \nSeries Producer: Stuart Cabb \nCopyright BBC 2006 \nbbc.co.uk/mischief/  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://akas.imdb.com/title/tt1024834/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://akas.imdb.com/title/tt1024834/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e38e218ea83922e4b1176c2de57be565948dd590","amp;dn":"Mischief%3A+Circumcise+Me%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e38e218ea83922e4b1176c2de57be565948dd590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,142,33,142,168,57,34,228,177,23,108,45,229,123,229,101,148,141,213,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
