Beginning with the armature assembly and block out, he demonstrates his method for building up a rigid, yet still flexible, base onto which he will build up his sculpture. At this stage, he begins to add clay to begin defining the forms of his &quot;stylized&quot; orangutan character, all the while narrating specific anatomical and creative choices he makes as he builds up the forms. He then moves in with tools to begin fine tuning the sculpture, creating folds and refining forms before moving into the detailing phase. In this phase, he demonstrates how to sculpt skin wrinkles and pores, as well as how to handle long fur on a character. When finished, David creates a highly believable, yet stylized interpretation of an orangutan.\n\nPublished 23 July 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e99343270e846bac328b4c045e200460e3480d","amp;dn":"Gnomon+-+Sculpting+a+Stylized+Character+with+David+Meng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e99343270e846bac328b4c045e200460e3480d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,233,147,67,39,14,132,107,172,50,139,76,4,94,32,4,96,227,72,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
