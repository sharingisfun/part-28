She was born in Brooklyn, New York, and was raised in Detroit, Michigan. At the age of 10, she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At age 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with R.Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records.\nAaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million; it sold 3.7 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first major film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single &quot;Try Again&quot;. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this feat. &quot;Try Again&quot; earned Aaliyah a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocalist.\nAfter completing Romeo Must Die, Aaliyah filmed her part in Queen of the Damned. She released her third and final album, Aaliyah, in July 2001. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in an airplane crash in The Bahamas after filming the music video for the single &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;.The pilot, Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and had traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court. Since then, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases. Aaliyah recorded several number one R&amp;B hits and five top ten Billboard Hot 100 singles. Aaliyah sold 32 million albums worldwide. She has been credited for helping redefine R&amp;B and hip hop, earning her the nicknames &quot;Princess of R&amp;B&quot; and &quot;Queen of Urban Pop&quot;. She is listed by Billboard as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and 27th most successful R&amp;B artist overall.\n\nAlbums:\n\nAge Ain't Nothing but a Number (1994)\nOne in a Million (1996)\nAaliyah (2001)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec8ff214d10dab5842da03a0241a2350bdbcc7b","amp;dn":"Aaliyah+-+Discography+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec8ff214d10dab5842da03a0241a2350bdbcc7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,200,255,33,77,16,218,181,132,45,160,58,2,65,162,53,11,219,204,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
