The Leipziger Quartet recorded the composer's complete output for this instrument combination in a 9 disc set in the late 1990s. This upload presents the 15 numbered quartets but omits the rest of the set: the minuets and dances, etc. The set was released by MDG and was given the highest praise in the 2002 edition of the Penguin Guide.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22ec9b2ea19a4c838b391641f2e13ff7e39f8e89","amp;dn":"Schubert+-+The+String+Quartets+-+Leipziger+Qt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22ec9b2ea19a4c838b391641f2e13ff7e39f8e89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,236,155,46,161,154,76,131,139,57,22,65,242,225,63,247,227,159,142,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
