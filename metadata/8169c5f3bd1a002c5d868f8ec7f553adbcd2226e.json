Rodrigo Amado, Joe McPhee, Kent Kessler, Chris Corsano\r\n.. â€“ This Is Our Language (Not Two Records)\r\n\r\nReviews\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nBy Bruce Lee Gallanter \nhttp://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/Main/news/Newsletter-2015-09-25.html\r\n\r\nThis mighty fine session was recorded in a studio in Lisbon, Portugal in\r\nDecember of 2012. Portuguese saxist Rodrigo Amado consistently leads or\r\nco-leads several bands, all of which are strong. Besides working with other\r\nplayers from Portugal he has worked with a number of other inspired greats: Jeb\r\nBishop, Peter Evans, Dennis Gonzalez and Steve Swell. Here again, he has chosen\r\na great crew, some of whom have worked together before (McPhee &amp; Chris Corsano\r\nhave a couple of duo discs) and some who haven't. This is a more organic\r\nsession that starts slowly and builds and is superbly recorded. There is some\r\nspirited, intense and tight interplay here, especially between Mr. Amado on\r\ntenor sax and Mr. McPhee on pocket trumpet or alto sax. Mr. McPhee occasional\r\nsings or bends his voice through his horn, adding a unique quality to the\r\nproceedings. I caught the relatively young drummer Chris Corsano a few weeks\r\nago with Sylvie Courvoisier &amp; Nate Wooley at I-Beam. Corsano is just incredible\r\nin any situation and watching him play is always great since his approach is\r\nunique and fun to watch. He is in the center of the storm here and he and\r\nMr. Kessler work extremely well together. This is yet another winner from the\r\nfine folks at Not Two!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Peter Gough and Martin Schray \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/11/rodrigo-amado-this-is-our-language.html\r\n\r\nBy Clifford Allen \nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD53/PoD53MoreMoments2.html\r\n\r\nBy Derek Taylor\r\n\r\nBy Mark Corroto \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/this-is-our-language-rodrigo-amado-not-two-records-review-by-mark-corroto.php\r\n\r\nBy John Sharpe \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/this-is-our-language-rodrigo-amado-not-two-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php\r\n\r\nAv: Joacim Nyberg (se) \nhttp://www.soundofmusic.nu/recension/rodrigo-amado-joe-mcphee-kent-kessler-chris-corsano-our-language\r\n\r\nJan Granlie (no) \nhttp://salt-peanuts.eu/record/rodrigo-amado-2/\r\n\r\nGuy Peters (nl) \nhttp://www.enola.be/muziek/artikels/25970:the-portuguese-connection-2015-pt-1-drie-internationale-kwartetten\r\n\r\nRui Eduardo Paes (pt) \nhttp://jazz.pt/ponto-escuta/2015/10/09/rodrigo-amado-our-language-not-two-records/\r\n\r\nPar Franpi Barriaux (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Rodrigo-Amado-3472318.html\r\n\r\nPar Luc Bouquet (fr)\r\n\r\nPor S.
