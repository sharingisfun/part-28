FlÃƒÂ³rez brings a connoisseur?s discernment to this programme of Latin American songs. Make no mistake: This most elegant of operatic artists lavishes upon these canciones the passion and authenticity of one who was, literally, to the manner born. His father, RubÃƒÂ©n FlÃƒÂ³rez, had a fine career in Lima as an interpreter of popular songs, notably those of Chabuca Granda, the singer-songwriter known as ?the soul of Peru.? And FlÃƒÂ³rez?s earliest musical memories are of family songfests that went on into the wee hours of the night.\n\n?I would sing a bolero that I learned from one of my father?s cassettes or that I heard my mother sing, or Peruvian music.?\n\nIn the past, he explains, ?the way popular music and opera were sung was more linked. Maybe pop musicians used more falsetto, but they had educated voices. Just listen to our Latin American singers like Carlos Gardel or Jorge Negrete [Mexico?s immortal ?charro cantor? (singing rancher)]. ?Negrete auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera!?.In the early and mid-twentieth century, when many of these songs were written, the line between classical and pop music was less sharply drawn than today. ?If you look back at the major tenors ? Caruso, Tito Schipa, Jussi BjÃƒÂ¶rling ? they all sang music from their roots. There was probably more ?crossover? than now,? FlÃƒÂ³rez points out. Past opera stars, including Alfredo Kraus and FlÃƒÂ³rez?s fellow Peruvian Luigi Alva, sang this programme?s songs with immense distinction. \n\nFlÃƒÂ³rez personally arranged the four songs closest to his heart ?those from his native Peru: the traditional La jarra de oro (The golden jug), along with Chabuca Granda?s La flor de la canela (The cinnamon flower), Fina estampa (Fine figure), and Bello durmiente (Sleeping beauty). FlÃƒÂ³rez plays bongos on Fina estampa; the chaste setting of Bello durmiente is for voice and solo guitar.\n\nAmong the three Chabuca Granda songs, Bello durmiente is something of a rarity. ?The title implies that Peru has so much, is rich and beautiful, but doesn?t move forward because it?s asleep. But the song itself speaks about the beauty of the regions ? the jungle, the Andes, the coast ? and says that they are Peru?s lovers. The song is about Chabuca?s love for her country.?\n\nFlÃƒÂ³rez speaks with awe of this passionate poet and musician. ?Chabuca cared so much for people, for her Lima. She cried out in many of her songs that Lima was being neglected, that traditions were being lost. She was a very strong and emotional woman.? FlÃƒÂ³rez himself shows considerable passion when evoking his country?s struggles with poverty and unemployment, and considerable joy when telling of being acknowledged on Lima?s streets as Peru?s musical ambassador to the world. ?We need to feel proud. With a nation like ours, in an economic crisis ? for us, the achievements of our fellow Peruvians represent hope.?\n\nDeep as his love is for his homeland and its songs, FlÃƒÂ³rez ends the conversation with reflections on the importance of all Latin American music. For FlÃƒÂ³rez, the songs on this programme are much more than a light-hearted detour for a great opera star. In his view, they have enriched and, to a considerable extent, moulded his art and that of such admired colleagues as PlÃƒÂ¡cido Domingo, Marcelo Ãƒï¿½lvarez, and Rolando VillazÃƒÂ³n.\n\n?In opera, you have to be in control of the melody, of your voice. But if you can really let it flow, phrase it and shade it like a bolero, a tango? Latin American singers, they all have something of this. You can call it class, you can call it taste ? it comes from our music, from Latin American music.?\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\nTRACKLIST\n\n01 Alma llanera\n\tPedro ElÃƒÂ­as GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, arr.
