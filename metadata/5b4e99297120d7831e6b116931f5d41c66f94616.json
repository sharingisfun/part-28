As the owner of the local bakery, Sweet Treasures, she thinks she has finally found some peace and quiet. That is until the Conner Brothers stake their claim.\nSteven and Neil Conner want only one thing, the sweet and sassy redhead who makes the best damn sticky buns in Treasure Cove. They are off to a good start, until the night of the McDaniel party, which ruins everything. Not giving up, they try unsuccessfully to explain their way out of the biggest cluster Treasure Cove has ever seen.\nWhen a chance encounter thrusts all three of them into a dicey situation, they must learn to work past their differences before someone gets hurt. Running from an unknown assailant, the three of them learn that looks can be deceiving, and that learning to trust again just might be the only way to survive. \nGenre: Erotica","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4e99297120d7831e6b116931f5d41c66f94616","amp;dn":"Joyce-Rebecca-Fighting-for-Hazel.epub.EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4e99297120d7831e6b116931f5d41c66f94616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,78,153,41,113,32,215,131,30,107,17,105,49,245,212,28,102,249,70,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
