His effort is much appreciated. :-)\n\nNOTE: This is a little something-something to go along with this torrent: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10582628&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10582628&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCelebrating 10 years of Jason being published in the US, this comic-book-format one-shot is a Jason fan's dream, with lots of previously unpublished Jason strips and artwork, an interview with Jason's colorist Hubert, a checklist of all Jason's books, a Q&amp;A with the man himself, and a visual tributes gallery by several American cartoonists to the towering, taciturn Norwegian genius including Michael Allred, Kim Deitch, and Rich Tommaso.\n\nThanks to phillywilly-Empire for the digital copy.
