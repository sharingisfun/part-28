With &quot;Missiles&quot;, this Montreal band have emerged as elder statesmen of the indie rock renaissance.\nPosting on their MySpace, Lightburn and Natalia Yanchak said how: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½We want to bring you this record whole and still warm. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s beautiful; that is the only way to describe it. A blues album, essentially. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s also long and kind of paced for love making, because that really makes everything better. 58 minutes, 16 seconds, 10 songs. One song is over 11 minutes, just like the old days. Come October, we encourage you to seek it out; it is worth every penny and all the dough just goes back into making more records, not buying solid gold houses.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269c61ffa6367959156cf702fc4e453f107627ee","amp;dn":"The+Dears+-+Missiles+%5Bmp3-vbr-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269c61ffa6367959156cf702fc4e453f107627ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,156,97,255,166,54,121,89,21,108,247,2,252,78,69,63,16,118,39,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
