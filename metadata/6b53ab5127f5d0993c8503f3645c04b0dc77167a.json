SOO I MADE THIS DVD FROM THAT RELEASE.\n\nFOR DETAILED INFOTMATION: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2534111\n\n\nI HAVE INTEGRATED MSDaRT TOOLSET TO WINDOWS 7 DVD.ITS VERY USEFUL TOOLS KIT.\n\nWhat is MSDART?\n\n\n\nDid you lost your files due to virus infections? Or was it the sudden loss of power that wiped out all your documents? John may have\n inadvertently \nreformatted the hard drive and your computer would not boot anymore.\n\nDisasters come in unexpected times and if you lost your computer data due to the aforementioned causes, you will need a utility that \nis called MSDART,\n Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset. Recover data instantly with this utility from Microsoft.\n\nDeleted files and reformatted drives are usually recoverable if no further additional damage follows. And MSDART may be able to recover \nthem.\n\nMSDART lets you fix a corrupted, unbootable Windows XP or Windows Vista installation. It contains several tools designed specifically for \ndiagnostics \nand recovery.\n\nVersions of MSDART\nMSDART has two versions available. MS-DART version 5 is specifically designed for use with Microsoft Windows XP and MSDART Version 6 is \nfor Microsoft \nWindows Vista.\n\n\n\n\nHow does MSDART Work?\n\nIn order to use MSDART, it has to be booted from a CDROM drive. During the boot up process and before MSDART completely loads it scans any\n installed\n hard disk and checks if it can find an installed Windows XP or Windows Vista and if it finds one, it will ask you if you want to attach \nto the installed\n operating system. Attaching to an operating system will let you access its Windows Registry and other system files as if you booted from \nit. If you do not \nattach to an operating system, MSDART will boot itself and treat the installed disk drive as if it does not have any installed operating \nsystem.\n\nMSDART Tools and Utilities\nRegistry Editor - program for accessing the system registry. It lets modify system and application program settings and configurations.\n\nLocksmith - unlocks the user and administration password. If you forgot your password for logging into Windows, this utility will let you \nreset and change \nthe password.\n\nCrash Analyzer - this is a debugging tool meant to be used by highly trained technical personnel.\n\nFile Restore - restores deleted files and programs.\n\nDisk Commander - a tool for managing the different files\n\nDisk Wipe - this is a privacy tool designed to completely delete the contents of a disk drive. When you delete or format a drive, data and \ninformation may \nstill exists on the hard which may be accessed and recovered by computer forensic tools. Using Disk Wipe will completely delete the disk\n drive making any \ndata recovery impossible.\n\nComputer Management - this program includes the system administration tools like the Event Viewer, Shared Folder, Local Users and Groups,\n Performance Logs \nand Alerts and Device Manager, Disk Defragmenter, Disk Management, and many more.\n\nExplorer - this utility is similer to Windows explorer.\n\nSolution Wizard - walks thru different problem scenarios and suggest solution on how to fix it.\n\nTCP/IP Config - provides the necessary tools to configure the Local Area Network adapter.\n\nHotfix Uninstall - sometimes hotfixes or security patches causes side-effects and prevent the system from functioning properly. This \nutility allows you to\n uninstall any hotfix that may be causing any problem.\n\nSearch - lets you do full searches for any file or directory.\n\nClean Room Data Recovery - With more companies specializing in data recovery services, one particular aspect that has importance is what \ntype of facility \nare you sending your hard drives into for that special data recovery. There are facilities that don't treat hard drives with the most care\n when they are \ntrying to recover your data, however they bill you like they do. There are also recovery methods and facilities that take extraordinary\n precautions with \nyour hard drive and data. These facilities employ clean room data recovery methods.\n\nData Recovery When The Hard Drive Initialization Fails - The computer hard drive is a primary data storage device, which is used for \npermanent and reliable\n data storage. Hard drive stores digital information on moving hard drive platters. But in some situations, your BIOS (Basic Input/Output\n System) can not \nrecognize your hard drive and thus the system does not boot up.\n\nData Recovery after Damage to Hard Drive Head Alignment System - Several computer hard drives contain read/write heads and servo head \nmounted for \nconcurrent movement by the actuator arm in response to the servo signal from server head. In such drives the positions of read/write heads\n are separately\n adjustable with respect to servo head.\n\n\n\nI have ALSO ADDED X64 BIT RECOVERY CONSOLE TO DVD.SO YOU CAN REALLY USE X32 AND X64 SUPPORTED SYSTEM ANYWHERE WITH MSDaRT TOOLSET!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Read carefully this before installing system!! \nI have scanned all entire DVD with Norton IS.If you think there is virus,trojan scan deeply before installing!!
