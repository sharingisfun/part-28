The course begins with an overview of what a digital SLR is and takes a tour of the camera's basic components.

After Ben briefly defines each option, he shows how to adjust it using the camera's controls.\n\nBen also discusses white balance options, advanced metering and autofocus controls, flash, live view, and video shooting.
