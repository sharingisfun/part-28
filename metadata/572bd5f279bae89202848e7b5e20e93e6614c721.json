Spent an hour unable to figure ot what I was doing wrong that\nthe 51 min show was demuxing to only 41 minutes. Rebooted my computer and gave up.\nDecided to get the MKV instead and just as it was almost downloaded - saw the MP4\nRePack. Well, now you get to sample the other encoding method for this. 640x360 is a\nlittle bigger than 624x352. I think the MP4 sources look a little softer, maybe a hard\nedge is just right for this show.\n.\nOhhh... nekkid boobies ...
