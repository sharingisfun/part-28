With 3CDs of the anthemic, the classic and the iconic, 12&quot;/80s Alternative focuses on New Wave, Goth, Indie-Guitar and Industrial genres, blending big hitters with era-defining underground club tracks.\nOpening the collection is probably the most timeless, iconic and biggest selling 12&quot; of the 80s, New Order's &quot;Blue Monday (1982 12&quot; Version)&quot;. Then there are anthems and classic cuts from Bauhaus, Killing Joke, Sisters Of Mercy, The Mission, Spear Of Destiny, the Kevorkian mix of The Cure's &quot;Hot Hot Hot!!!&quot;, Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees, plus superlative extended mixes of Simple Minds, Big Country, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, Visage, Cabaret Voltaire and Propaganda.\nAlso included are the lesser-compiled tracks and mixes from Soft Cell, Tears For Fears, Frankie Goes To Hollywood's (&quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; (An Alternative To Reality Mix)), the Gary Langan mix of Scritti Politti's &quot;Absolute&quot; and the rare, original Steve Nye 12&quot; remix of &quot;Nightporter&quot; by Japan.\n\n [img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img]\n\n\nDisc One\n\n    * 1.
