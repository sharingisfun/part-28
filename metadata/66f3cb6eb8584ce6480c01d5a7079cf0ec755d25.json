They argue that crucial evidence (or a telling lack of evidence) at digs in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon suggests that many of the most famous stories in the BibleÃ¢â‚¬â€the wanderings of the patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt, JoshuaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conquest of Canaan, and David and SolomonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vast empireÃ¢â‚¬â€reflect the world of the later authors rather than actual historical facts.\n\nChallenging the fundamentalist readings of the scriptures and marshaling the latest archaeological evidence to support its new vision of ancient Israel, The Bible Unearthed offers a fascinating and controversial perspective on when and why the Bible was written and why it possesses such great spiritual and emotional power today.\n\n385 pages\nPublisher: Touchstone; Reprint edition (June 11, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0684869136\nISBN-13: 978-0684869131","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f3cb6eb8584ce6480c01d5a7079cf0ec755d25","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Unearthed+%282002%29+by+Israel+Finkelstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f3cb6eb8584ce6480c01d5a7079cf0ec755d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,243,203,110,184,88,76,230,72,12,1,213,167,7,156,240,236,117,93,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
