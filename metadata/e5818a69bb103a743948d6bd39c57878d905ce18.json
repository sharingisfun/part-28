The woman is Eva Braun (Elena Rufanova), and she is anxious and excited, waiting for her beloved &quot;Adi&quot;, Adolf Hitler (Leonid Mosgovoi) to spend a few intimate hours with her. When Hitler arrives he is accompanied by his first officer Martin Bormann (Vladimir Bogdanov), his head of propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Leonid Sokol) and his wife Magda Goebbels (Elena Spiridonova) to spend a few days in rest and recovery. As the days move forward Hitler and Eva are seen to relate in the most human of ways. The two confront obstacles including Hitler's upset stomach, preoccupation with waging a war, and exclusive nature of his immediate staff and Eva's attempt to find common ground on which to communicate with everyone. As Eva eventually breaks through to some emotional level with &quot;Adi&quot;, she discovers new truths about the man, and their common needs.\n\n\nDirected by  Aleksandr Sokurov\t\n\nWriting Credits (in alphabetical order)  \n\nYuri Arabov\t...\t (writer)\nMarina Koreneva\t...\t (writer) \n\nCast (in credits order)  \n\nElena Rufanova\t    ...
