The melodies and dub lines of previous Orb recordings are still in the mix, and the esoteric bent of Pomme Fritz is muted somewhat. Orbus Terrarum is definitely not the place to start, but it's still a worthy successor to U.F.Orb. The final track, &quot;Slug Dub,&quot; is an ambient epic with vocal samples taken from a children's story.
