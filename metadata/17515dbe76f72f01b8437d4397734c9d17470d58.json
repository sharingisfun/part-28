Born in Peru and raised in the English West Country, Rowley has been mentored by Carleen Anderson and now follows up on the success of that EP with Little Dreamer, an album that continues her sweetly old fashioned, Motown-esque blend of blues, gospel, soul and jazz--all peppered with a classic mainstream sheen. Produced by Steve Power (Blur) and Kevin Bacon &amp; Jonathan Quarmby (Richard Hawley, Finlay Quaye), the album discloses a voice as jaw-droppingly flawless and hopelessly compelling as a Norah Jones or Amy Winehouse, but with atmospheric traces of Karen Carpenter, Aretha Franklin and Eva Cassidy too. Tracks like the stunning gospel blues of &quot;Almost Persuaded&quot; and soulful single &quot;Oh My Life&quot; are good examples of what to expect from this cozy, feelgood album. The reggae pulse of &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; tends to undermine the power and beauty of the original, but slow, heartfelt blues numbers like &quot;One Cloud&quot; more than make up for these blips. Rowley plays it safe on Little Dreamer, but it&amp;#039;s a stunning collection nonetheless. --Danny McKenna\n\n1. Nobody&amp;#039;s Fault But Mine\n2. Sweet Hours\n3. So Sublime\n4.
