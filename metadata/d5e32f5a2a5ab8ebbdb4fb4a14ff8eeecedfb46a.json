In an unabated, 48 hour fit of rage, Kinski destroyed every piece of furniture in sight. From this chaos, a beautiful albeit volatile partnership was born. In 1972, Herzog cast Kinski in Aguirre, The Wrath of God. Four more films would follow. In this personal documentary, Herzog traces the often violent up and downs of their relationship, revisiting Munich apartment where they first met - and thrashed, and the various locations of their films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200849/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200849/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e32f5a2a5ab8ebbdb4fb4a14ff8eeecedfb46a","amp;dn":"WERNER_HERZOG_KINSKI_MY_BEST_FIEND_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e32f5a2a5ab8ebbdb4fb4a14ff8eeecedfb46a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,227,47,90,42,90,184,235,189,180,251,74,20,255,142,238,206,223,180,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
