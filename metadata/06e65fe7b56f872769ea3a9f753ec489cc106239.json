When grizzled \nwar veteran Ambrose McKinley (Nick Damici) is forced into moving there by \nhis yuppie son Will (Ethan Embry), the residents immediately take offense \nto Ambrose's abrasive personality. But that take-no-prisoners attitude may \nbe just what Ambrose needs to survive as it becomes clear that the attacks \nare being caused by creatures that are neither animal nor man, and that the \ntight-knit community of Crescent Bay is hiding something truly sinister in \nits midst... Following the release of his Here Comes The Devil, as well as \nhis scene-stealing segment B is For Bigfoot in the horror anthology The \nABCs of Death, AdriÃƒÂ¥n GarcÃƒÂ®a Bogliano cements his status as one of the \ntop horror filmmakers coming out of Spain with LATE PHASES. In a bookend \nof sorts to his performance in the cult hit Stake Land, Nick Damici commands \nthe screen here, coming on the heels of last year's Sundance vigilante \nthriller Cold In July and the critically acclaimed cannibal drama, We \nAre What We Are.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Nick Damici.\n=&gt;-Lance Guest.\n=&gt;-Ethan Embry.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Adrian Garcia Bogliano.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Horror : Drama : Action.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2014.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.28 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 905 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 36mn.\n=&gt;-Late Phases................: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2420756/\n=&gt;-Late Phases................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/late_phases_2014/\n=&gt;-Late Phases................: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/late-phases-2014/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 528.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1788 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 190 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06e65fe7b56f872769ea3a9f753ec489cc106239","amp;dn":"Late+Phases+-+Horror+2014+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06e65fe7b56f872769ea3a9f753ec489cc106239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,230,95,231,181,111,135,39,105,234,58,159,117,62,196,137,204,16,98,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
