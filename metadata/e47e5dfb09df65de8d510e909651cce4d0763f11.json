If I were looking for &quot;The Art of Hellboy&quot;, say, I'd scroll down to that point in the alphabet (line ~26,500), and voila, there are three versions:\n\nThe Art of Hellboy (2003) (digital) (Minutemen-InnerDemons).cbr (45.65 MB)\nThe Art of Hellboy (2003) (digital) (Son of Ultron-Empire).cbr (128.78 MB)\nThe Art of Hellboy(2003)(Digital)(Tyrant Lizard King-EMPIRE).cbr (115.61 MB)\n\nFinding download locations for any or all of those versions is another matter, but that's what search engines are for, and feeding those with release names rather than just titles makes them vastly more efficacious. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47e5dfb09df65de8d510e909651cce4d0763f11","amp;dn":"Hitlists+browseable+%2B+searchable+%282012-04+-+2013-08%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47e5dfb09df65de8d510e909651cce4d0763f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,126,93,251,9,223,101,222,141,81,14,144,150,81,204,228,208,118,63,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
