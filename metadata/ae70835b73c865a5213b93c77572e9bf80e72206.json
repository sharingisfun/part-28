Now a college English professor in Kansas City, Courtney is determined to experience one more summer in this sun-swept paradise. Her reason for going is personal: Courtney needs to know whether Robinâ€™s brother James shares the feelings sheâ€™s secretly had for him.\r\n\r\nTime with the Vickerey family always involves love and laughter, and this season is no different. Vivacious matriarch Susanna Vickerey is celebrating her sixtieth birthday, but beneath the merriment, trouble is brewing. The family patriarch, Dr. Alastair Vickerey, is quiet and detached, while unspoken tension looms over oldest son Henry, a respected young surgeon. Warm and witty Robin, the most grounded of the siblings, is keeping a secret from her parents. Iris, the colorful baby of the brood, remains rudderless and in need of guidance. And the sexy, stunningly handsome, untouchable Jamesâ€”to Courtneyâ€™s dismayâ€”may be in love with a beautiful and vibrant local artist. As the summer unfolds, a crisis escalates, surprising truths are revealed, and Courtney will at last find out where her heart and her future lie.\r\n\r\nWeaving the trials and uncertainty of real life into a tapestry of passion, hope, and courage,The Island House is a beautifully told story about the ties that bind usâ€”and how the blessings of love and family heal us in ways we never dream possible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae70835b73c865a5213b93c77572e9bf80e72206","amp;dn":"The+Island+House+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae70835b73c865a5213b93c77572e9bf80e72206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,112,131,91,115,200,101,165,33,59,147,199,117,114,233,191,128,231,34,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
