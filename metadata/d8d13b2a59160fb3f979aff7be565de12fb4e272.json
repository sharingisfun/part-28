Freeway To Fire\n\n\nA review from Amazon.com:\n\nThe single of BLOODLIGHTS/TALKING BOMBS perfectly captured THE BEST qualities of THE FREEZE. Some of the most self-loathing, sad yet not hopeless lyrics yet from Clif Hanger and two different Classic guitar riffs by Bill Close that absolutely burn their way into your psyche. The lyrics to THE CRIMINAL INSIDE have got to be some of the best since classic CLASH of the first two lp\\\\\\&amp;#039;s\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d13b2a59160fb3f979aff7be565de12fb4e272","amp;dn":"The+Freeze+-+Misery+Loves+Company+%281990%29+-+Boston+punk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d13b2a59160fb3f979aff7be565de12fb4e272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,209,59,42,89,22,15,179,249,121,175,247,190,86,93,225,47,180,226,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
