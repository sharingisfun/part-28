In it, you will hear the original composition &quot;Shambala&quot;, which was revived me from her original genre New Age and implemented using a large set of tools in the best traditions of Traditional Electronics. This album is, in the opinion of some fans, obhal entire planet. Professional musicians are familiar with synthesizers, often do not believe, on which it was created. No one has ever used the keyboard samoigrayki this is the way to express here is a musical form. The recording quality - not so hot, there are errors of execution, but back in those days, modern technology has been to me unfortunately simply not available. There is a saying - &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention.&quot; We had to order poshevilit brains to sound of the album was not like the sound of a standard samoigrayki YAMAHA PSR-510, which has been created. In my plan is to completely rewrite the job, because there was a technology that can replicate the sound of the most unique of its kind semi YAMAHA unit from the computer without resorting to any external devices :) I do not know when I will implement these plans, but I do I know that this is a must do.
