Infamous for unpredictable attacks, catchy raiding songs, hatred of dogs, and fear of horses, goblins blend mischief and murderousness like no other monsters.\n\nAnd Pathfinder fans adore them! Since their appearance in the very first Pathfinder release, Pathfinder goblins have starred in numerous adventures and game supplements, and now they get their own comic book series!\n\nDon't miss this series featuring an all star line up of talent! Issue 1 includes &quot;The One-Eyed Goblin is King,&quot; written by Adam Warren with art by Carlos Gomez and &quot;Prize Pupil,&quot; written by Paizo Publisher Erik Mona and illustrated by Shane White.
