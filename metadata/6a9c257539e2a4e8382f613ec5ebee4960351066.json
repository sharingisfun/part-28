At that time, the \nRoman Emperor, Claudius II, didn't want any of his young men to get married or \nhave children, because he thought it would hurt their ability to become good \nsoldiers. \n\n&quot;Well, Saint Valentine defied Claudius II's law and performed secret marriages \nto young couples in love. In time, he was caught, jailed, and put to death. \nBut before he died, Valentine himself met a woman and fell in love, with the \njailer's daughter. He sent her notes, which he signed, 'From your Valentine' -- \nthe legend which, of course, lives on today.\n\n&quot;So why should we listen to Emerson and trust ourselves? Maybe trusting ourselves \nis the only way what's meant to be, can be. And when that happens, if you're \nSaint Valentine, you end up being the embodiment of romantic love for centuries \nto come.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9c257539e2a4e8382f613ec5ebee4960351066","amp;dn":"Valentine%27s+Day+-+Ed+s1e14+Xvid-mp3+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9c257539e2a4e8382f613ec5ebee4960351066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,156,37,117,57,226,164,232,56,47,97,62,197,235,238,73,96,53,16,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
