I rose quietly, left the room, and holding my head high, walked back to my office. My main goal was to escape as quickly as posÃ‚Â­sible. The board had seemed scaredÃ¢â‚¬â€why else would they have acted the way they did. But just what were they scared of?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nWhen Michael Woodford was made president of OlympusÃ¢â‚¬â€the company to which he had dediÃ‚Â­cated thirty years of his careerÃ¢â‚¬â€he became the first Westerner ever to climb the ranks of one of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corporate giants. Some wondered at the appointmentÃ¢â‚¬â€how could a gaijin who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even speak Japanese understand how to run a Japanese company? But within months WoodÃ‚Â­ford had gained the confidence of most of his colleagues and shareholders. Unfortunately, soon after, his dream job turned into a nightmare.\n \nThe trouble began when Woodford learned about a series of bizarre mergers and aquisiÃ‚Â­tions deals totaling $1.7 billionÃ¢â‚¬â€a scandal that threatened to bring down the entire company if exposed. He turned to his fellow executivesÃ¢â‚¬â€ including the chairman who had promoted him Tsuyoshi KikukawaÃ¢â‚¬â€for answers. But instead of being heralded as a hero for trying to save the company, Woodford was met with vague responses and hostilityÃ¢â‚¬â€a clear sign of a cover up. Undeterred, he demanded to be made CEO so he could have more leverage with his board and continue to search for the truth. Then, just weeks after being granted the top title, he was fired in a boardroom coup that shocked Japan and the business world at large. Worried his forÃ‚Â­mer bosses might try to silence him, Woodford immediately fled the country in fear of his life and went straight to the pressÃ¢â‚¬â€making him the first CEO of a global multinational to blow the whistle on his own company.\n \nFollowing his dismissal, Woodford faced months of agonizing pressure that at times threatened his health and his family life. But instead of sucÃ‚Â­cumbing he persisted, and eventually the men who had ousted him were held to account. Now, Woodford recounts his almost unbelievable true storyÃ¢â‚¬â€from the e-mail that first alerted him to the scandal, to the terrifying rumors of involveÃ‚Â­ment with the Japanese mafia, to the stream of fruitless denials that continued to emanate from Olympus in an effort to cover up the scandal. He also paints a devastating portrait of corporate JapanÃ¢â‚¬â€an insular, hierarchy-driven culture that prefers maintaining the status quo to exposing ugly truths.\n \nThe result is a deeply personal memoir that reads like a thriller narrative. As Woodford puts it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I thought I was going to run a health-care and consumer electronics company, but found I had walked into a John Grisham novel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39104d31f53cacf2cc257af46ea55c4ae272a17c","amp;dn":"Exposure%3A+Inside+the+Olympus+Scandal%3A+How+I+Went+from+CEO+to+Whi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39104d31f53cacf2cc257af46ea55c4ae272a17c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,16,77,49,245,60,172,242,204,37,122,244,110,165,92,74,226,114,161,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
