As he told critic Neil Strauss in 1995, &quot;If I have some work that I've done and want to talk about, that's why I end up doing interviews&quot;.\nHere is an unprecedented collection of Springsteen on Springsteen, spanning the past four decades.\nIt begins in 1973, when he is earning $75 a week and struggling to emerge from the New Jersey bar circuit. It ends in 2012, by which time The Boss has achieved worldwide fame and has shared a platform with the likes of John Kerry and Barack Obama.\nThis collection features interviews by well-known media figures including, US talk show host Charlie Rose, novelist Nick Hornby, and rock critics Paul Williams and Neil Strauss.\nIt also includes rare gems from smaller periodicals that even serious Springsteen fans may not know.\nIn addition are transcripts of radio and TV interviews that have not previously appeared in print.\nTaken together they trace the unique trajectory of an incomparable artist hanging onto his integrity throughout the days of youthful ambition and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a bigger challenge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the years of superstardom.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Burger has captured the heart, soul, and essence of Bruce Springsteen by stripping away the rock superstar's public veneer and replacing it with first-person interviews . . . If you seek to know more about what's inside the man, how he feels about his life, and how he has looked at the world at large across the landscape of his career, this book delivers that and more . . . This book is indeed a must-buy item.&quot;--Paul Collins for the [New Hampshire] Telegraph\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A remarkable journey across the arc of a singular careerÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes harrowing, ultimately heroic, revealing a tremendous strength of character as the Boss stayed true to his ideals, even in the face of what he calls Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcatastrophic success.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ A great read about a genuine American hero. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hungry to learn about the true soul of this remarkable man, look no further: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all here.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Paul Zollo, author of Songwriters on Songwriting\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Bruce Springsteen has been interviewed around the world on radio and television and by newspapers, fanzines, and general-interest and music magazines. Many of his most engrossing conversations are housed in this book. Fans should welcome this valuable collection. I know I do.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Harvey Kubernik, author of Canyon of Dreams: The Magic and Music of Laurel Canyon\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A great collection. The only other way to experience this much of SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœvoiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is to see him in concert.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Patrick Harbron, longtime Springsteen photographer\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦This collectionÃ¢â‚¬â€which compiles an extensive number of interviews and encounters with Springsteen dating back to 1973Ã¢â‚¬â€is a great illustration of how, when the appropriate subject is chosen, no one on earth can say it better than [than Bruce] himself. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Impressively thorough Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Rolling Stone\n\n&quot;This book is a must for any Springsteen lover as it has so much Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not only a wide range of interviews in all media , here and overseas, but a collection of beautiful speeches written and delivered by the Boss over the years. Journalist-author Jeff BurgerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of the subject comes across in this vast profusion of unexpected material heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovered, allowing the reader to view Springsteen from many angles, and over the decades.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Paul Zollo for American Songwriter\n\n&quot;Don't get me wrong, Springsteen on Springsteen is definitely geared toward someone who already knows the finer points of the life and music of Bruce Springsteen. But it is definitely worth making room for on the Boss Bookshelf.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Bob Ruggiero for the Houston Press\n\n&quot;Not many books go this in-depth when it comes to collecting the words said off the stage by a major celebrity musician. Burger does just that. He has collected a treasure trove of Springsteen in the public eye, speaking his mind and, as usual with Bruce, he bares his soul, putting it all out there for all too see. This is a good read.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Classic Rock Revisited\n\n&quot;But what overall makes Springsteen on Springsteen a fun read despite its potentially academic or historical air is the focus Burger spent on selecting pieces where Springsteen does the talking. This offers the reader an opportunity to see forty years of Springsteen through his voice, though this time the speaking one rather than the singing.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Guitar Digest\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJeff Burger is the author of published articles in more than 75 magazines and newspapers, including BarronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, Family Circle, GentlemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Quarterly, Golfweek, High Fidelity, the Los Angeles Times, and ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Digest.
