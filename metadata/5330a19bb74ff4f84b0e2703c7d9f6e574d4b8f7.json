That is why the FonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Budai ZenehÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡z set to work to provide the financial background and facilities necessary to do this comprehensive collection of Transylvanian village music.\nThe Final Hour project is supported by the Institute of Musiscology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Starting in September 1997, there have been regular recording sessions with bands from Transylvanian villages who still play the local traditional music. Each band is at our disposal for five days during which time it is possible to make archival recordings of not only each bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repertoire of melodies which serves the entertainment needs of more than one ethnic group, but also to document information regarding customs surrounding the traditional music and dance life. Singers and one or two couples of good dancers arrive to Budapest for these recording sessions with each band, helping to maintain the vocal and dance function of the instrumental music. Part of the program is devoted to documentation of the existing Transylvanian traditional flute music.\nThe CD archive resulting from work of the Final Hour program offers a vast amount of material on the musical traditions of Hungarians, Romanians, Gypsies, Saxons and Jews in Transylvania for research studies as well as a wealth of authentic material and background information for those involved in popular folk music movements. The complete collection will be available for scientific research in the archive of the Institute of Musicology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\nThe FonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Records has started this series of CDs under the title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tria,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ presenting selections of the most representative material from the collection. This series is the spiritual descendant of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡triaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series from the end of the 1930ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s by BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k, ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n KodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ly and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Lajtha in cooperation with the Hungarian Radio and the Museum of Ethnography.\n\nVol6: The Upper MureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ River Valley and its folk music traditions: In terms of geography, the name of this region comes from the river basin which starts at the uppermost reaches of the Maros (MureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸) river following it all the way down to the city of MarosvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rhely (TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rgu MureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸). A century ago a mixed population of Romanians, Hungarians, Gypsies, Saxons and Jews inhabited this area, in our time however, the latter two ethnic groups have decreased to a minimum. The exploration of the folk music of the region began relatively late, though it came along with important findings which have been definitive in 20th century music history. In several of BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³kÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s works melodies are used which he collected from this area in his compositions. BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³kÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other important finding from this area was the so-called three stringed viola which is used exclusively for playing accompaniment consisting of triads. In the Upper MureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ River Valley the cymbalom was established as an integral part of the local bands. We have made recordings for this CD of how the band sounds both with and without the cymbalom.\nBecause of GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyoroszfalu (SolovÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™stru)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s geographical location, and given that the transportation conditions in the Upper MureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ River Valley were more favorable than in the Transylvanian Heath (MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g) area, PiluÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band was often invited by Romanians, Hungarians, Gypsies and Jews alike to play in the surrounding areas. Their extraordinarily rich repertoire motivated us to make selections of material which have filled up these two CDs. Given that PiluÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band was most often hired to play in Romanian villages, most of his vocabulary of melodies make up the material played for Romanians, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important to know that a significant portion of the melodies when played for the other ethnic groups are adjusted with smaller or larger variations to fit the type of music requested by the audience at hand. Track 4 on CD 1 includes two melodies which are played as lullabies for Romanians in the GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ny (Gurghiu) Valley, though the same melodies are used as laments and soldierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs by the Hungarians in the Kalotaszeg (Huedin) area and in the Transylvanian Heath (MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g). The melody of track 3 of CD 1 is also interesting. First it is heard as a slow processional couple dance, de-a-lungu, then it is used for the fast turning couple dance, forgatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s (or invirtita), as in the European dances of the Renaissance period, wherein the same melody is used for a slow dance and for a fast one as well. In the slow dance the rhythm is syncopated, but in the fast one it is no longer the case. In fact this melody was also recorded by BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k in 1914 with the musicians in FelsÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©pa (RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢pa de Sus), he then used it in his 1st Rhapsody written for violin and piano in 1928.\n\nVol7: \nJÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³d (Ieud). Original Village Music from MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros (MaramureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸): MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros is situated in the northern part of Transylvania; a mountainous, forested region with flew flat areas and many rivers. On the south the Gutin Mountains separate it from the rest of Transylvania, with the only openings towards the west through the Tisza River valley and the city of SzatmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meti (Satu Mare).\nRomanian music from MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros was presented to the people for a long time as being the most ancient Romanian music. Indeed upon hearing the music with its repeated motifs and simple harmony accompanied on the so-called &quot;zongora&quot; (&quot;piano&quot; - the local name for a specially tuned guitar), one is definitely reminded of medieval music. Most of the old melodies with repeated motifs can be recognized as bagpipe tunes taken over by the violin. Since the memorable collecting expeditions of BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k, the &quot;zongora&quot; (guitar) has been supplemented with more strings (today more major chords can be played as accompaniment, moving parallel to the melody) and the drum with a cymbal attached to it has also appeared.\nThe traditional dances of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros are &quot;Feciorescu&quot;, &quot;BÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™trÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®nescu&quot;, &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â½nvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®ta&quot; and the &quot;De bÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™ut&quot; used for partying (&quot;for drinking&quot; which are not for dancing &quot;but the character of their music is such that I must definitely categorize them amongst the dances&quot;, BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k said). They also play style pieces, like Pintea's Ballad (Pintea was a famous MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros outlaw from the previous century) or the &quot;Kurva's (whore's) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®nvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®ta&quot; (a rather piquant story about a woman of loose morals). \nThe music of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros also has another face which the people from MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros refer to as Hungarian. It has been preserved by the Gypsies and can be considered a relative of the music of the central Transylvania. This style of music is not for dancing but for table entertainment (&quot;de masÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™&quot; - table tunes) or is used in connection to various customs such as for dressing the bride.\nThe Gypsy material follows the Transylvanian structure with related local dances and dance melodies. The most pointed difference between the two styles is shown in the use of the guitar (&quot;zongora&quot;): in the traditional MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros music only a few major chords are played, while in the Gypsy music of the area, already a fully developed functional form of harmony is shown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5330a19bb74ff4f84b0e2703c7d9f6e574d4b8f7","amp;dn":"Uj+Patria+vol+6%267+-+Village+music+from+transylvania","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5330a19bb74ff4f84b0e2703c7d9f6e574d4b8f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,48,161,155,183,79,244,248,75,14,39,3,199,217,246,229,116,212,184,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
