And, by gaining rare firsthand testimony from German veterans, and access to the untapped diaries and documents we reveal that this was a battle of two sides and many layers. Part of the Battle of Britain season to mark the 70th anniversary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25fc75bba31854b76dd4ae54814a5206a73fff0d","amp;dn":"Battle_of_Britain_The_Real_Story+BBC.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25fc75bba31854b76dd4ae54814a5206a73fff0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,252,117,187,163,24,84,183,109,212,174,84,129,74,82,6,167,63,255,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
