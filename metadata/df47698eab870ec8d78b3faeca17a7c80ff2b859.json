During the first day, the family moves in smoothly except for the dog, who refuses to come into the house. That night, the children play a game called hide-and-clap; while playing, one of the daughters finds the boarded up entrance to a cellar. After Roger inspects the basement with a match, the family goes to bed. Carolyn expresses concern because the dog is barking outside, and two of the daughters feels someone pulling at her feet.\n\nIn the morning, Carolyn wakes up with a mysterious bruise and the dog is found dead. Over the next couple of days, various paranormal activities occur; doors open and close seemingly by themselves, all of their clocks stop at the same time, and Carolyn hears clapping when nobody is there. At night, Cindy sleepwalks into Andrea's bedroom, where she bangs her head repeatedly against an old wardrobe. The activity culminates one night while Roger is away in Florida. Carolyn is locked in the basement while Andrea is attacked by a spirit that looks like an elderly woman.\n\nCarolyn seeks the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren, noted paranormal investigators, to validate their concerns. Lorraine senses that a particularly malevolent spirit has latched on to the family. They conduct an initial investigation, and conclude they should get involved, explaining to the Perron family that the house may require an exorcism. However, this cannot be done without further evidence and authorization from the Catholic Church as well as the Vatican. Ed is also concerned for Lorraine, who experienced trauma during a former case of theirs in which an exorcism was required.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df47698eab870ec8d78b3faeca17a7c80ff2b859","amp;dn":"The+Conjuring+TSCamRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df47698eab870ec8d78b3faeca17a7c80ff2b859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,71,105,142,171,135,14,200,215,139,63,174,202,23,167,200,15,242,184,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
