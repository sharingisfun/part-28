Apparently they connect somehow with one or the other's former guitarist. After searching for a couple days, I realized that high(er) quality rips of these tracks were pretty rare, and after finding a couple rars on eMule andas well as some mp3s from the Visual Collection torrent, I decided to &quot;normalize&quot; the tracks with a little hard limiting, equalizing and gloss reduction. What came about was one of the most complete demos I've seen available, and definitely the best quality available.\n\nI guess they're in the studio to record their debut, so check these out in the meantime. Bear with upload speeds, google WildBlue in the meantime. Then warn everyone you know to stay away from it.\n\n320K Source MP3s are now 224k VBR MP3s.\n192K Source MP3s are now 192k VBR MP3s.\n128k Source MP3s are now edited 160k/192k VBR MP3s.\n\nTags include comments with original demo collection track numbers. Limited and unreliable info lead me to delete the predicted years for the tracks. Demo '08 just seemed so much easier.\n\nThese are the tracks included:\n\n01. Lost\n02. Falling Behind\n03. Losing You\n04. Angels of Clarity\n05. Erased\n06. A Promise\n07. Stronger\n08. Unhatable\n09. Promise Me\n10. Trapped\n11. My Saviour\n12. Carry Me\n13. In My Arms\n14. Leafs Falling\n15. Painting Shadows [Webrip Edit]\n16. Where I Belong [Webrip Edit]\n17. I Made It [Webrip Edit]\n18. Found Myself In You [LQ Webrip]\n19.
