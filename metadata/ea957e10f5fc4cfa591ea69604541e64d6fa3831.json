The team's star player (in real life as well as in this feature) Magnus &quot;Mackan&quot; Haerenstam is playing pick-up soccer with a five-year old boy, hardly paying any attention at all, when he begins to notice that the boy is good, and that he is really having to work hard to keep up with him. To his disgust, he discovers that the boy is far better at dribbling than he is. He quits the team and has the boy known as Fimpen (lit. &quot;the cigarette butt&quot;) take his place. One highlight for fans of soccer is soccer-star Georg &quot;Aby&quot; Erickson's appearance as one of the boy's teammates. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Fimpen.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,232,439,296 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:23:35\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 696x280 (AR: 2.486)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1732 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.356 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 224 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071498/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071498/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSwedish audio; English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German subpack\n\nMy rip\n\nBo Widerberg - Fimpen (1974)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea957e10f5fc4cfa591ea69604541e64d6fa3831","amp;dn":"Bo+Widerberg+-+Fimpen+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea957e10f5fc4cfa591ea69604541e64d6fa3831","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,149,126,16,245,252,76,250,89,30,166,150,4,84,30,100,214,250,56,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
