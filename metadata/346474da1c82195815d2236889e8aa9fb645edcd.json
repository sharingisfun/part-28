Released in March 1995 on the album &quot;Relish&quot; and produced by Rick Chertoff, it became a top 40 hit in November of that year. Roch Parisien called the song &quot;a simple, direct statement of faith, honest and unadorned, one framed in a near-perfect chorus and delectable Neil Young-ish guitar riff.&quot; In 2007, the song was ranked at #54 on &quot;VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's&quot;.\n           &quot;Wrapped&quot; is a song written by the Peruvian singer and songwriter Gian Marco and sung by Gloria Stefan, released as the first single from her tenth studio album Unwrapped. The single returned the commercial success to Gloria, having charted in various countries. This single is Gloria's highest charting song in Switzerland, reaching the Top 3 and certified Gold for its strong sales. Gloria also debuted in Belgium within the Ultratip Top 10.The video, which is the same as for the Spanish version of the song, &quot;Hoy&quot;, was filmed at Peru in the legendary city Machu Picchu.\n          &quot;Don't!&quot; is a song by  Shania Twain. It was the second single released from her 2004 Greatest Hits album. &quot;Don't!&quot; debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart the week of January 29, 2005 at number 44, Twain's fourth highest debut of all time, and highest of the week. The single spent 15 weeks on the chart and climbed to a peak position of number 24 on April 2, 2005, where it remained for one week. &quot;Don't!&quot; became Twain's first single to miss the top 20 since 2000's &quot;Rock This Country!&quot;.In the UK, &quot;Don't!&quot; appeared at its peak position of number 30 on March 12, 2005. This became, and remains, her lowest peaking single in that country, and only remained on the chart for two weeks. It fell to number 57 in its second week, then fell off the chart completely. To date, it is her last single to chart in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.   2000s IN MUSIC  (the decade of 2000-2009)\n\n         In North America and  Europe  pop and dance music subgenres, such as dance-pop, teen pop and bubblegum pop, have remained popular throughout or in parts of the decade. Similarly to the 1990s, hip hop and contemporary R&amp;B also remained highly popular genres throughout the decade. Despite the hip hop dominance which lasted for the decade, rock music was still popular, notably alternative rock, and especially genres such as Post-grunge, Nu metal, pop punk, emo, \n       Despite a slight slip of popularity in the early part of the decade, adult contemporary and country music were still able to find success throughout the 2000s. Electronic music was also highly popular throughout the decade; at the beginning of the 2000s, genres such as trance, chillout, house, indietronica and Eurodance (in Europe) were popular, yet, by the latter end of the decade, dance-oriented forms of electronic music, such as synthpop, electropop, Nu-disco and electro house had become popular. By the end of the decade, a fusion between hip hop and electronic dance which had originated in the 80s, known as electro hop, also became highly popular.\n      In Latin America, Latin pop music remained popular throughout the decade. Reggaeton became a definitive genre in 2000s Latin music, as well as salsa and merengue. Subgenres fusing Latin music such as merengue and reggaeton with hip hop and rap music became popular from the mid-part of the decade onwards.\n     Unlike many past decades, the 2000s did not see the creation of as many new genres, with the exception of a few indie-related genres such as emo rock and post-indie\n\n\n\n12.01\tPOP MUSIC  (2000 - 2009)\n       \n            ROBBIE WILLIAMS  - The Road To Mandalay (2001)            \n            DELTA GOODREM  -  Born To Try  (2003)\n            DELTA GOODREM  -  Lost Without You  (2003)\n            DELTA GOODREM  -  Not Me Not I  (2003)\n            DELTA GOODREM  -  A Year Ago Today  (2003)  \n            GLORIA ESTEFAN  -   Wraped  (2003)     \n            SHANIA TWAIN  -  Don't!

Mainstream modern R&amp;B has a sound more based on rhythm than hip hop soul had, and lacks the hardcore and soulful urban ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgrindingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feel on which hip-hop soul relied. That rhythmic element descends from new jack swing. R&amp;B began to focus more on solo artists rather than groups as the 2000s progressed. As of 2005, the most prominent R&amp;B artists include Usher, BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©  and Mariah Carey whose music often blurs the line between contemporary R&amp;B and pop.\n\n           \n           LUCY PEARL  - DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T MESS WITH MY MAN   (2000)\n           WYCLEF JEAN &amp; MARY J.BLINGE -  911  (2000)\n           TONI BRAXTON  -  HE WASNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T MAN ENOUGH   (2000)\n           NELLY  -  PIMP JUICE  (2002)\n           WYCLEF JEAN &amp; CLAUDETTE ORTIZ  -  TWO WRONGS   (2002)\n           R.KELLY ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SLOW WIND   (2005)\n           T-PAIN  feat.

Even today, all around the world, classic Soul is as popular now as it was during its early days back in the 1960s. But although there are plenty of Soul legends, there are also plenty of contemporary artists keeping the legacy of the art form alive. Anthony Hamilton, Mary J. Blige and others are among the deep, gritty soul artists who are among today's best.\n\n             ROBERTA FLACK  - KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH THIS SONG  (2000) \n             SOLOMON BURKE - DON'T GIVE UP ON ME   (2003)\n             LIONEL RICHIE  -  SAY YOU , SAY ME   (2007)\n             THE 5th DIMENSION   - AQUARIUS &amp; LET THE SUN SHINE IN (2007}\n\n\n\n           Neo soul is a term coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s.  According to music journalist Greg Kot, musical collective Soulquarians with members from Philadelphia, New York, Detroit, Richmond, Brooklyn, Chicago, Dallas, and Oakland., contributed significantly to the neo soul movement during the late 1990s to the early 2000s. The founding members of the collective are Ahmir Thompson a.k.a. Questlove from The Roots, D'Angelo, James Poyser, and J Dilla. Being a collective, they included a rotating list of members, including Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, Erykah Badu, Bilal  and Raphael Saadiq.\n         During the early to mid 1990s, the neo soul movement continued to grow with releases by ZhanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Groove Theory, Joi, Tony Rich, and Me'Shell NdegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ocello.  Other  neo soul artists broke through with their debut albums, including Macy Gray, Angie Stone, Lauryn Hill and Jill Scott.  The 1997 film Love Jones capitalized on neo soul's success at the time with its soundtrack album, which impacted the Billboard charts and featured artists such as Hill, Maxwell, The Brand New Heavies, Me'Shell NdegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ocello, Groove Theory, and Dionne Farris.  \n\n                ANGIE STONE   -  Wish I Didn't Miss You (2001)\n\n           Hip hop soul is sub-genre of contemporary R&amp;B which fuses R&amp;B, neo soul and dance elements with hip hop. The term did not originate until the promotion for Mary J. Blige's debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat's the 411?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  in 1992 when Uptown Records proclaimed her to be the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot; and generally describes a style of music that blends soulful R&amp;B singing and raw hip hop production. The genre served as a middle point between two other hip hop/R&amp;B blends, new jack swing and neo soul, and while it was most popular during the mid-1990s with the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot; Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, and Aaliyah, it still finds popularity with newcomers such as Ashanti, BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Aaliyah, Alicia Keys, Keyshia Cole and Amerie.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.07. SMOOTH JAZZ  -   FUSION OF SOUL, R&amp;B, JAZZ and SOFT ROCK   \n\n\n          Smooth jazz is a genre of music that grew out of jazz fusion and is influenced by R&amp;B, funk, rock, and pop music styles (separately, or, in any combination). In general, a smooth jazz track is downtempo, layering a lead, melody-playing instrument (saxophones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially soprano and tenor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are the most popular, with guitars a close second) over a backdrop that typically consists of programmed rhythms and various pads and/or samples \n      .  Smooth jazz groups or recording artists tend to play their instruments in a melodic fashion such that they are recognizable within just a few measures; this category includes names such as saxophonists Kenny G, David Sanborn, the late George Howard, Najee and Art Porter, Jr.; guitarists George Benson, Marc Antoine, Peter White, Johnathan Butler, Ray Parker, Jr, Norman Brown, Ronny Jordan, and Yves Vincent; pianists Joe Sample, David Benoit, and Bradley Joseph. Some performers, such as Dave Koz, Bob James, and Nathan East are notable for their numerous collaborations with many of the genre's big names. Groups include Fourplay, Pieces of a Dream, Acoustic Alchemy, Airborne and The Rippingtons. Female performers include Keiko Matsui, Joyce Cooling, Mindi Abair, Candy Dulfer, Sade, Brenda Russell, Pamela Williams, Regina Belle, and Anita Baker.\n\n          \n\n              SADE  -  KING OF SORROW  (2000)\n              SADE  -  KING OF SORROW  (2002)  - concert version\n              SADE  -  PARADISE   (2002) - concert version            \n\n\n\n\n12.08. TRANCE  &amp; HOUSE  MUSIC  (2000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2009) \n\n           Trance is a style of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s. Trance can be understood as a combination of many forms of electronic music such as industrial, techno, and house. As this music is frequently played in nightclubs, vacation spots and inner cities, trance can be understood as a type of club music. Trance music is broken into a large number of genres. Chronologically, the major genres are  Classic trance, Acid trance, Uplifting Trance, Epic trance, Progressive  trance ,Stadium trance or Euphoric trance. Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, tech trance is a mixture of trance and techno.\n\n\n           SONIQUE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IT FEELS SO GOOD  (2000)\n           SONIQUE  -  SKY  (2000)\n           SONIQUE  -  ALIVE  (2003)\n           SONIQUE  -  WORLD OF CHANGE  (2010)\n\n\n12.09.\tLATIN POP MUSIC \n\n           Latin pop  generally refers to pop music that has what may be perceived a Latin American influence. Geographically, it could refer to pop music from Latin America or sung by Latin Americans, generally regarded as Hispanics in the United States. There are two main variants. The first one is regular pop performed in the Spanish, Spanglish, Portuguese or English for international audiences. The second one mixes pop with a wide variety of Latin American or Iberian rhythms such as salsa, samba, norteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a, merengue, banda, tex-mex, flamenco, tango, reggaeton, vallenato, and reggae. Some of the most successful artists are Selena, Enrique Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Carlos Santana, La India, Marc Anthony, Juanes and Miami Sound Machine. Julio Iglesias is regarded to date as the world's best selling Latin artists selling 100 million albums worldwide\n\n          MARC ANTHONY  - I Need To Know  (1999)\n          MARC ANTHONY -  Tragedy (2002)\n\n\n\n12.10.   REGGAETON ,ROMANTIQUEO, KUDURO &amp; ETHNIC MUSIC  \n\n            Reggaeton is a form of urban music that became popular with Latin American youth in the early 1990s. After its mainstream exposure in 2004, it spread to North American, European and Asian audiences. Originating in Panama, reggaeton blends West-Indian music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America, such as bomba, plena, salsa, merengue, latin pop, cumbia and bachata as well as that of hip hop, contemporary R&amp;B, and electronica.\n           Ethnic music, especially in near tropical locations is mainstream for most of the mid to late '00s, especially with hits by Shakira and M.I.A. and the rise of  Reggae/Pop/Dance artists like Sean Paul, Sean Kingston and Rihanna early in the mid to late 2000s.\n          Romantiqueo is a sub-genre of Reggaeton. It is a fusion of Pop, R&amp;B, and Reggaeton. The name Romantiqueo comes from the words &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;mixeo&quot; (Puerto Rican slang for mix).  Zion y Lennox are considered to be the pioneers of Romantiqueo. Magnate y Valentino, Tito &quot;El Bambino&quot;, De La Ghetto, Randy, Don Omar, Divino, RKM &amp; Ken-Y, Cruzito and Baby Rasta are among those who have made a name in the genre.\n         Kuduro (or kuduru) is a type of music originally born in Angola in the 1980s. Reinvented in Portugal, the genre gained international popularity. It is characterized as uptempo, energetic, and danceable.\n\n           DON OMAR  -  Angelito  (2006)\n           DON OMAR  -  CanciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n De Amor (2007)     \n           ZION  feat.

It has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have incorporated influences ranging from roots rock, bluegrass, rockabilly, honky-tonk, alternative rock, folk rock, and particularly punk. It is generally agreed that alternative country drew on traditional American country music, the music of working people, preserved and celebrated by practitioners such as Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and The Carter Family, often cited as major influences.   Another major influence was country rock, the result of fusing country music with a rock &amp; roll sound. Some of the significant artists in the genre are: Dave Alvin, Neko Case,  Justin Townes Earle, Alison Krauss amd  Gillian Welch .\n\n            \n            CALEXICO  -  Ballad Of Cable Hogue  (2000)\n            CALEXICO  -  Ballad Of Cable Hogue  (2004)\n            CALEXICO  -  Quattro (World Drifts In )  (2004)\n            CALEXICO  -  Sunken Waltz  (2004)\n            CALEXICO  -  El Picador  (2004)\n            CALEXICO  -  Crystal Frontier  (2006)\n            CALEXICO  -  Alone Again Or  (2006)\n            CALEXICO  -  El Gatillo  (2008)\n            CALEXICO  -  Cruel  (2008)\n\n\n12.12. TEJANO MUSIC \n\n          Tejano music or Tex-Mex music (Texan-Mexican music) is the name given to various forms of folk and popular music originating among the Mexican-American populations of Central and Southern Texas. In recent years, artists such as Selena, often referred to as &quot;The Queen of Tejano&quot;, Alicia Villarreal, Elsa Garcia, Laura Canales, La Mafia, Jay Perez, Mazz, and Jennifer PeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a have transformed Tejano music from primarily Tejano, ethnic form of music to a genre with wide appeal in people who like Tejano.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:346474da1c82195815d2236889e8aa9fb645edcd","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+363","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"346474da1c82195815d2236889e8aa9fb645edcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,100,116,218,28,130,25,88,21,210,35,104,137,232,170,159,182,69,237,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
