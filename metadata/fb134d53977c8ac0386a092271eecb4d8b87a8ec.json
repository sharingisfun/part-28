Those familiar with ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own best-selling memoir or his campaign speeches know the touchstones and details that he chooses to emphasize, but nowÃ¢â‚¬â€from a writer whose gift for illuminating the historical significance of unfolding events is without peerÃ¢â‚¬â€we have a portrait, at once masterly and fresh, nuanced and unexpected, of a young man in search of himself, and of a rising politician determined to become the first African-American president.\n\nThe Bridge offers the most complete account yet of ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic father, a brilliant economist who abandoned his family and ended his life as a beaten man; of his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, who had a child as a teenager and then built her career as an anthropologist living and studying in Indonesia; and of the succession of elite institutions that first exposed Obama to the social tensions and intellectual currents that would force him to imagine and fashion an identity for himself. Through extensive on-the-record interviews with friends and teachers, mentors and disparagers, family members and Obama himself, David Remnick allows us to see how a rootless, unaccomplished, and confused young man created himself first as a community organizer in Chicago, an experience that would not only shape his urge to work in politics but give him a home and a community, and that would propel him to Harvard Law School, where his sense of a greater mission emerged.\n\nDeftly setting ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political career against the galvanizing intersection of race and politics in ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, Remnick shows us how that cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complex racial legacy would make ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forays into politics a source of controversy and bare-knuckle tactics: his clashes with older black politicians in the Illinois State Senate, his disastrous decision to challenge the former Black Panther Bobby Rush for Congress in 2000, the sex scandals that would decimate his more experienced opponents in the 2004 Senate race, and the storyÃ¢â‚¬â€from both sidesÃ¢â‚¬â€of his confrontation with his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. By looking at ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political rise through the prism of our racial history, Remnick gives us the conflicting agendas of black politicians: the dilemmas of men like Jesse Jackson, John Lewis, and Joseph Lowery, heroes of the civil rights movement, who are forced to reassess old loyalties and understand the priorities of a new generation of African-American leaders.\n\nThe Bridge revisits the American drama of race, from slavery to civil rights, and makes clear how ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest is not just his own but is emblematic of a nation where destiny is defined by individuals keen to imagine a future that is different from the reality of their current lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb134d53977c8ac0386a092271eecb4d8b87a8ec","amp;dn":"The+Bridge-+The+Life+and+Rise+of+Barack+Obama+by+Dmnick+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb134d53977c8ac0386a092271eecb4d8b87a8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,19,77,83,151,124,138,192,56,106,9,34,113,238,203,77,139,135,168,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
