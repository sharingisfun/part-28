With their funky, guitar-driven soulful sound, Bubonik Funk are regularly cited as a groove and jam band. However, the band's individualistic style draws from many sources and transcends any one music genre. Bubonik Funk did not release songs from their initial album virally, as they preferred to develop their sound and style further. \n\nBubonik Funk is held in high regard for their emphasis on independent management, full control of the creative process, and a widening sphere of popularity despite any aid from commercial companies or record labels. In 2007, the band began playing shows in the Charlotte area, venues such as Tremont Music Hall, Neighborhood Theatre, and the Evening Muse. \n\nBy 2009, Bubonik Funk had played as far north as Boston, and for college crowds of UNC Chapel Hill, East Carolina University, UNC Wilmington and Berklee School of Music in Boston. \n\nAs of 2010, the band has released two E.P.s. Ã¢â‚¬Å“OTBÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wink at the DevilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Both albums were self produced with a single production engineer, Dustin Hofsess. Creative control, album art and distribution fell in the hands of the band itself. \n\nBubonik Funk has played with respected musicians such as Soulive, Laura Reed and the Deep Pocket, Cyril Neville, and last July played Verizon Wireless prior to Phish. The band has done a 45 minute radio interview with Davakar of 106.5 The End and performed their song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Woman in My BasketÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nZabooki is the band's latest album for 2012.
