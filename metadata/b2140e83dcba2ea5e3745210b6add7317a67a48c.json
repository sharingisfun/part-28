Live From Glasgow is the debut DVD from the UK's fastest rising comedy star. Filmed in May 2010 at Glasgow's SECC Arena in front of a sold out crowd of 10,000 fans.\n\nAt the age of just 23, Kevin, Scotland's 'Young comedy prodigy' has followed a meteoric path, from his appearance on BBC 1's first episode of 'Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow' to starring in 'Stand Up For The Week'. Other TV appearances include 'Live at the Apollo', 'Friday Night with Jonathan Ross', 'Have I Got News For You', 'Mock The Week', '8 Out Of 10 Cats', Channel 4's 'Comedy Gala In Aid Of Great Ormond St Hospital'.\n\nKevin's unique brand of social commentary, astute observations and sharp one-liners arguably make him the hottest act to come out of Scotland in the last ten years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2140e83dcba2ea5e3745210b6add7317a67a48c","amp;dn":"kevin+bridges-the+story+so+far+%5Blive+in+glasgow%5D+aac+mp4+by+wink","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2140e83dcba2ea5e3745210b6add7317a67a48c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,20,14,131,220,186,46,165,227,116,82,16,182,173,215,49,122,103,164,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
