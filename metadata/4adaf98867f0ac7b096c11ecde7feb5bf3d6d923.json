If you want me to expand, I'd call it contemporary Joan Jett-type hard rock. And it's darn good. All of the songs are toe-tappingly good (especially &quot;Now is the Time&quot;), and I have to give a special mention to the acoustic cover of Iron Maiden's &quot;Wasted Years.&quot; Using acoustic guitar and some light keyboarding (or is that a real string instrument?), Noelle's vocals on top, this all adds up to create a new dimension to one of my favorite Iron Maiden songs.\r\n\r\nDamone, a Boston based punk-metal band who scratch out non-radio friendly anthems that we'd recommend to anyone who ever liked Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Joan Jett or more recently Sahara Hotnights and Andrew WK. Anyone who appreciates big, fearless rock n roll will appreciate Damone. But they're not just arena rockers singing about rad parties and hot chicks, this band has teeth and claws and if they must, they'll use them to eat you. Oh yeah, and their frontman? Yeah, she's a woman but really that's neither here nor there, because she has the strength of ten men and a voice that proves it. Their  album, Out Here All Night really rocks!\r\n\r\nTracks\r\n\r\n\r\n1    Now Is the Time\r\n2    Out Here All Night\r\n3    What We Came Here For\r\n4    Stabbed in the Heart\r\n5    On Your Speakers\r\n6    Get Up and Go\r\n7    Outta My Way\r\n8    You're the One\r\n9    New Change of Heart\r\n10   When You Live\r\n11   Tonight\r\n12   Wasted Years (Iron Maiden cover)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4adaf98867f0ac7b096c11ecde7feb5bf3d6d923","amp;dn":"Damone+-+Out+Here+All+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4adaf98867f0ac7b096c11ecde7feb5bf3d6d923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,218,249,136,103,240,172,123,9,108,17,236,222,127,235,91,243,214,217,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
