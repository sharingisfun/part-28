The gorgeous vocals of Freyda Epstein and Lorraine are intertwined like a rose and its bramble, which incidentally is one of the tracks here (Bramble and the Rose). The title track is also very good. \n\nStylistically this is celtic-tinged folk with some classical chops thrown in for good measure, as Freyda was a classically trained violinist. \n\nMany years ago I tracked her down through the record company and she autographed a stack of CD's that I sent her. The scanned artwork includes her autographs. \n\nSadly she was killed some time ago in a collision caused by a murderer fleeing the scene. But her music lives on. You can also d/l the album 'Live at Cabell Hall' by Freyda and Acoustic Attatude that I have also uploaded which is uniformly excellent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c3798856c6337fc20925f092795514340713bf7","amp;dn":"Trapezoid-Cool+of+the+Day%3B+classical%2Ffolk%2Fdulcimer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c3798856c6337fc20925f092795514340713bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,55,152,133,108,99,55,252,32,146,95,9,39,149,81,67,64,113,59,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
