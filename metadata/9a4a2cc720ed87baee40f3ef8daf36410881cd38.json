The original group consisted of Rick Danko (bass guitar, double bass, fiddle, trombone, vocals), Garth Hudson (keyboard instruments, saxophones, trumpet), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, baritone saxophone, vocals), Robbie Robertson (guitar, vocals), and Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, vocals). All five members were notable musicians in their own right.\n\nAs its title implies, this 5 CD set is a biography, tracing the group's career from their early days as the Hawks supporting Ronnie Hawkins, through their stint as Levon &amp; the Hawks, through their time as Bob Dylan's backing band in 1966, through their emergence as the Band in 1968, then through their years of stardom in the early '70s, leading up to their departure at The Last Waltz in 1976. No previous compilation has done this.\n\nOf course, the material on &quot;A Musical History&quot; is excellent, The Band being one of the finest rock groups ever. Moreover, this box really does chart the musical history of The Band in chronological order, including material with Ronnie Hawkins and Dylan as well as material as Levon and the Hawks. The unreleased live material that is included is excellent (esp. &quot;Smoke Signal&quot; and the version of &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; with horns) and a real treasure.\n\nAlthough the Band was always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than with the general public, they have remained an admired and influential group. The group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them #50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2008, they received the Grammy's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nMedia Info:\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nChannels: joint stereo\nSamplerate: 44100\nEncoder: LAME 3.98MPEG-1 layer 3\n_______________________________________________________________________\nHope you enjoy the quality release\nContact us for help or other inquires at : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;016c637569646d71417860696e6e2f626e6c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bce3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;_____\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a4a2cc720ed87baee40f3ef8daf36410881cd38","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+A+Musical+History+%5B5CD%5D+%282005%29+%40320KBps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a4a2cc720ed87baee40f3ef8daf36410881cd38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,74,44,199,32,237,135,186,238,64,243,239,141,175,54,65,8,129,205,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
