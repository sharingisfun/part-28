From big to small, from the surreal to the real, from the instantaneous moments to the epic journeys; the music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s posted here is what we deem to be the perfect spark, partner or prelude to defining a strangely isolated place.\n\nAfter the success of the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut vinyl release, Uncharted Places, A Strangely Isolated Place returns with Europe, a meticulously curated compilation inspired by some of the most beautiful locations on the continent.\n\nSpanning ambient, modern classical, drone and electronica, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a journey experienced through the eyes and ears of the artists, capturing their memories, travels, tributes, and exquisite musical depictions.\n\nBeginning with a peaceful ode to her Greek home, Dalot finds harmony on Kalathas beach, Halo is enraptured by a wet city scene in Zurich, and 36 tries to make sense of LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s countless contrasts.\n\nIn more remote parts, Horizontal Excursions (aka Roger Martinez) discovers the symphony of life on the subtropical island of La Gomera, Bjorn Rohde paints a vivid picture of the PyrÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©es, and Marsen Jules finds paradise in the Andalusian mountains.\n\nFrom cosmopolitan utopias to breath-taking cornucopias, every track on Europe is immersed in discovery. Effortlessly traversing geography and emotions, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a collection that revels in borderless ambition but also celebrates the intricacies that makes every passage unique.\n\nCloser to sea-level, Dextro finds inspiration in the Isle of BarraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oceanic panorama, Parks channels the coastal howl of Helsingborg, and Carbon Based Lifeforms uncovers delicate harmonies in the Spring-time forests of East Gothenburg.\n\nFinally, Yagya brings Europe to its beautiful conclusion. Alone on ReykjavikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s north shore, the iconic producer forgets himself, and the city behind him, as the infinite ocean horizon commands his lost gaze.\n\nreleased 26 January 2015\n\nMastered by Rafael Anton Irisarri.\nArtwork by Nick Brzostowski.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/astrangelyisolatedplace/playlists/isolatedmix-series/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/astrangelyisolatedplace/playlists/isolatedmix-series/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73a7f092971719a979638d23ad6901b6b81875e9","amp;dn":"A+Strangely+Isolated+Place+%28VA%29+-+Europe+%282015%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73a7f092971719a979638d23ad6901b6b81875e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,167,240,146,151,23,25,169,121,99,141,35,173,105,1,182,184,24,117,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
