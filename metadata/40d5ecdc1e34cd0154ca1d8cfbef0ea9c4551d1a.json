From his childhood during America's Great Depression to the heady \n days of the space programme, his historic first step on the Moon and his \n famously private later life. Seen through the eyes of those who were with him, \n the film explores the man behind the myth, a man who was very much a product of \n his time.\n\n The filmgoes beyond his days as an astronaut and shows that his life after the \n flight of Apollo 11 was, in many ways equally challenging, as Armstrong came to \n terms with life outside NASA and the relentless demands of fame until his death \n in August 2012.\n\n From the producers of 'In the Shadow of the Moon'. Featuring interviews with \n Armstrong's first wife Janet, their two sons, Rick and Mark, Neil's brother and \n sister Dean and June, his best friend Kotcho Solacoff and second wife Carol. \n Fellow astronauts Mike Collins, Buzz Aldrin, Charlie Duke and Dave Scott also \n feature in this revealing biopic.\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4d2e2c3d79393b0d2a202c2421632e2220&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d5ecdc1e34cd0154ca1d8cfbef0ea9c4551d1a","amp;dn":"Neil.Armstrong.First.Man.On.The.Moon.720p.HDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d5ecdc1e34cd0154ca1d8cfbef0ea9c4551d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,213,236,220,30,52,205,1,84,202,29,140,251,239,14,169,196,85,29,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
