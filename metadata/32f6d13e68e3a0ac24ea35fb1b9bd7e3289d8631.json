The Black Cats, who have won their last two games against their old rivals, are looking to complete a league double over the Magpies for the first time since the 1996/97 season. Manchester United travel to the Britannia Stadium to play Stoke, a side they had beaten in 10 of 11 previous Premier League encounters. West Ham's game with Swansea and Cardiff City's meeting with Norwich have implications for teams involved at the wrong end of the table. The day's other games see Everton meet Aston Villa, Fulham play Southampton and Hull entertain Tottenham.\n\n\nNotes:\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps to give much smoother movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32f6d13e68e3a0ac24ea35fb1b9bd7e3289d8631","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+01-Feb-2014+720p+50fps+HDTV++x264-wAm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32f6d13e68e3a0ac24ea35fb1b9bd7e3289d8631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,246,209,62,104,227,160,172,36,234,53,251,27,155,215,227,40,157,134,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
