Viewers who enjoyed the original, will no doubt \nalso be thrilled with this sequel. I liked many aspects of this film, and will look forward \nto seeing more and more adult oriented American animation. My guess, is that Columbia chose \nto release this film straight to DVD because of it?s limited target audience. I would have \nliked to see this movie make it to my local cinema, but it was probably not a profitable \nchoice to market and distribute Heavy Metal 2000 to theaters. Fans of hard rock music and violent \ncartoons will be drawn to this film.\n\nStory-When lowly space pirate Tyler finds the key to the chamber of immortality, it turns him into\n a maniacal killer bent on mayhem and destruction. FAKK2, a woman of the planet Eden, takes it upon \nherself to kill Tyler when he devastates her home world. Assisted by various forms of aliens and monsters \nalong the way, FAKK2 and Tyler?s destiny?s become intertwined. She must race to find Tyler before he \nreaches the chamber of immortality, and becomes unstoppable. FAKK2 is not looking to save the world,\nshe just wants revenge.\n\nHeavy Metal 2000 features the voice talents of Micheal Ironside as Tyler, B-movie actress Julie Strain\n as FAKK2, and Billy Idol in a toned down performance as the priest Odin.\n\nThis film is rated R for some extremely mature animated scenes. Like the original, sex is used extensively,\n and the violence is gore-filled and bloody. Profanities are used a bit much in my opinion, but that\n is what you get from a movie that is trying to break rules.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469f2b5548c5ff1da8024615c5ef2e266b7419e5","amp;dn":"Heavy+Metal+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469f2b5548c5ff1da8024615c5ef2e266b7419e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,159,43,85,72,197,255,29,168,2,70,21,197,239,46,38,107,116,25,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
