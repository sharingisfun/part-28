The band originated in Boston, \nMassachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&amp;R head, in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop \nthat was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with \ntheir debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was called \na &quot;genuine rock masterpiece&quot; by Allmusic. Probably the most successful and well known song from the album, \n&quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the \nBoston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJs, which \nled to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977. The Cars have mentioned this numerous times \nincluding in their &quot;last&quot; interview in June 2000.\n\n\n   1. The Cars - Let's Go                                     [03:33]\n   2.
