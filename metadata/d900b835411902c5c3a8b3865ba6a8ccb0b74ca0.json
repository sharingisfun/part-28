Widely regarded as a pioneering album of the West CoastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s then-emerging alternative hip hop scene, The PharcydeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1992 debut Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde makes a triumphant reappearance two decades later in this deluxe 3xCD set by the good folks at Delicious Vinyl. Drawing from a laundry list of sampled jazz and soul greats to construct its musical sound scape, Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde marked the entry of The Pharcyde into the arena of beloved hip hop icons in the decades to come. Sonically, producer J-Sw!ftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jazzy sampling and lush instrumentation provide a stark contrast to the hard-hitting gangsta rap dominating West CoastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributions to hip hop of the time,\nfurther complementing the laid-back comedic lyricism of emcees Fatlip, Bootie Brown, Imani, and Slimkid3 with a style seldom heard since. This superbly arranged deluxe reissue includes the original album in its entirety, plus two additional discs including instrumentals, remixes, and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœb-cydes.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Fans will be pleased to find producer J-Sw!ftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extended liner notes included alongside vintage photos of the group. This deluxe reissue is housed in a beautiful hinged box with magnetic clasp emblazoned with the iconic rollercoaster cover art by Fuct.
