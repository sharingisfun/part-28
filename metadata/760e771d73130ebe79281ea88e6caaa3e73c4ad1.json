While interviewing a group of female convicts in Pozzuoli State Prison, Ferrara was deeply impressed by their fatalistic statements, and asked writers Peppe Lanzetta, Maurizio Braucci and Gaetano Di Vaio to create screenplays based on their life experiences. Di Vaio's episode is inspired by his actual experience as convict; Braucci depicts a sad and brutal coming of age and Lanzetta created a family melodrama of violence and vengeance. By interweaving the prison interviews with scenes stemming from real-life experiences, Ferrara weaves a complelling, multi-layered mosaic, which, like Naples itself, is both fascinating and complex at the same time.\n\n\nLanguages: Italian / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:760e771d73130ebe79281ea88e6caaa3e73c4ad1","amp;dn":"Napoli+Napoli+Napoli+2009+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"760e771d73130ebe79281ea88e6caaa3e73c4ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,14,119,29,115,19,14,190,121,40,30,168,142,108,170,163,231,60,74,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
