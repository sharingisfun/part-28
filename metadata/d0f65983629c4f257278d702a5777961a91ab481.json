But peer orientation undermines family cohesion, poisons the school atmosphere, and fosters an aggressively hostile and sexualized youth culture. It provides a powerful explanation for schoolyard bullying and youth violence; its effects are painfully evident in the context of teenage gangs and criminal activity, in tragedies such as in Littleton, Colorado; Tabor, Alberta and Victoria, B.C. It is an escalating trend that has never been adequately described or contested until Hold On to Your Kids. Once understood, it becomes self-evident -- as do the solutions.\n\nHold On to Your Kids will restore parenting to its natural intuitive basis and the parent-child relationship to its rightful preeminence. The concepts, principles and practical advice contained in Hold On to Your Kids will empower parents to satisfy their childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inborn need to find direction by turning towards a source of authority, contact and warmth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0f65983629c4f257278d702a5777961a91ab481","amp;dn":"Hold+On+to+Your+Kids+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0f65983629c4f257278d702a5777961a91ab481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,246,89,131,98,156,79,37,114,120,215,2,165,119,121,97,169,26,180,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
