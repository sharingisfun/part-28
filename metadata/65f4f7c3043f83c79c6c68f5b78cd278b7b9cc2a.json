This is what happens when you work Emergency Medical Services and ride in an ambulance. Chucking Granny is a humorous collection of stories about the first hundred EMS partners author E.S.T. had while working for a private ambulance corporation. EMTs, Paramedics, and anyone who has ever had co-workers will enjoy this series and connect with E.S.T.'s satirical portrayal of her various partners.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Have used Calibre for PC and Aldiko for Android (Samsung Note 10.01 - 2012 model) for the epub, and Kindle for PC and Android for the mobi file. All chapter links work using applications mention.\n\n\nPlease support this author if possible by purchasing the book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f4f7c3043f83c79c6c68f5b78cd278b7b9cc2a","amp;dn":"Chucking+Granny+ebook+by+E.S.T.+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f4f7c3043f83c79c6c68f5b78cd278b7b9cc2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,244,247,195,4,63,131,199,156,108,104,245,183,140,210,120,183,185,204,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
