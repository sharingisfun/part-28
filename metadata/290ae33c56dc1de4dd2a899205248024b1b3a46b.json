This technology is a program accumulating all the DNA database of all citizens whereby analyzing and matching the DNA evidence obtained from a crime scene to help provide the police with leads of suspects. The film starts with some murders happened at a hospital with an identical murder style that suggests the same serial killer is behind the job. Later CCTV surveillance showed the scientist was present at the scene of murder, leading to suspicion that he is involved. When he entered data of DNA into the database, he was surprised that DNA data matches his own and suggesting he was the killer. Police immediately try to take him back for investigation but as he was keeping the evidence data, he tries to escape. So who is the murderer? I wouldn't want to reveal the entire story, but i just want to comment that this film indeed is a little slow paced for me. The story could be good but there was some bland moment in the middle part that caused me to yawn. Overall, it would be worth watching if you are not in a hurry or in a relaxed mood.\n\nGeneral\n\n       \nFormat.......: Matroska\nFile Size....: 1.58 GiB\nDuration.....: 2h 13mn\nBitrate......: 1 697 Kbps\nSubtitles....: http://subscene.com/subtitles/platinum-data/english/792638\nEncoder&quot;.......JYK\nSource.......: BluRay\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2282917/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2282917/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nVideo Format......: AVC\nVideo Codec.......: x264 core 125 r2200bm 999b753     \nBitrate...........: 1 450 Kbps\nFrame Rate........: 23.976 fps\nWidth.............: 1 024 pixels\nHeight............: 426 pixels\naspect ratio......: 2.40:1\n\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat..........: AAC\nBitrate.........: 256 Kbps\nChannels........: 6 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage........: Japanese\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/7966/9wbt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/7966/9wbt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img546/1464/p21t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img546/1464/p21t.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img59/6959/epmp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img59/6959/epmp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img545/839/qch1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img545/839/qch1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290ae33c56dc1de4dd2a899205248024b1b3a46b","amp;dn":"Platina+Data+2013+576p+BRRip+x264+AAC-JYK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290ae33c56dc1de4dd2a899205248024b1b3a46b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,10,227,60,86,220,29,228,221,42,137,146,5,36,128,36,177,179,164,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
