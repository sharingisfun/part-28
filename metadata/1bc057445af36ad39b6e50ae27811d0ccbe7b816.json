The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nOn this Sunday, June 3 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex files a report from Chantilly, Virginia, where the Bilderberg meeting is wrapping up. This year's event drew a large number of activists and protesters opposed to the global agenda promulgated by the elite, including carbon taxes, the continued crash of the world economy, and endless wars of bankster conquest. Alex provides a run-down of events and what we can expect from the global elite now that they have concluded another confab held in America prior to an election.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
