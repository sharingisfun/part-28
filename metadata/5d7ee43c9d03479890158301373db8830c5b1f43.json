In doing so, it also documents how blurred the lines are becoming between classic gospel, R&amp;B, hip-hop, and urban soul. Traditionalists will certainly appreciate Hezekiah Walker's &quot;The Battle&quot; and Bishop T.D. Jakes's &quot;When My Season Comes.&quot; But the pop appeal of Virtue's &quot;Gotta Worship,&quot; Darwin Hobbs's &quot;Deeper,&quot; and Kirk Franklin's multicultural mover &quot;Unconditional&quot; carry the potential of drawing a whole new generation into the fold. Other highlights include the driven &quot;And Yet I'm Still Saved&quot; by Donald Lawrence, the hot horns of Lamar Campbell on &quot;When I Think About You,&quot; and the masterful Fred Hammond on &quot;You Are the Living Word.&quot;\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, June 2009\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7ee43c9d03479890158301373db8830c5b1f43","amp;dn":"WoW+Gospel+-+2002+-+WoW+Gospel+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7ee43c9d03479890158301373db8830c5b1f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,126,228,60,157,3,71,152,144,21,131,1,55,61,184,131,12,91,31,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
