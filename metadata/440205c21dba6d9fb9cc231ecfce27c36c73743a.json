Although a few songs remain rooted in their signature sound, here Jeff Tweedy and band are as fascinated by their music's possibilities as its origins, and they push the songs which make up this sprawling two-disc set down consistently surprising paths and byways. For starters, the opening &quot;Misunderstood&quot; is majestic psychedelia, built on studio trickery and string flourishes, while &quot;I Got You (At the End of the Century)&quot; is virtual power pop, right down to the handclaps. The lovely &quot;Someone Else's Song&quot; borrows heavily from the Beatles' &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; while the R&amp;B-influenced boogie of &quot;Monday&quot; wouldn't sound at all out of place on Exile on Main Street; and on and on. The remarkable thing is how fresh all of these seeming clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s sound when reimagined with so much love and conviction; even the most traditional songs take unexpected twists and turns, never once sinking into mere imitation. &quot;Music is my savior/I was named by rock &amp; roll/I was maimed by rock &amp; roll/I was tamed by rock &amp; roll/I got my name from rock &amp; roll,&quot; Tweedy sings on &quot;Sunken Treasure,&quot; the opener of the second disc, and throughout the course of these 19 songs he explores rock as though he were tracing his family genealogy, fervently seeking to discover not only where he came from but also where he's going. With Being There, he finds what he's been looking for. \n\n\n01 Misunderstood \tTweedy \t6:27\n02 Far, Far Away \tTweedy \t3:20\n03 Monday \tTweedy \t3:33\n04 Outtasite (Outta Mind) \tTweedy \t2:33\n05 Forget the Flowers \tTweedy \t2:46\n06 Red-Eyed and Blue \tTweedy \t2:44\n07 I Got You (At the End of the Century) \tTweedy \t3:56\n08 What's the World Got in Store \tTweedy \t3:09\n09 Hotel Arizona \tTweedy \t3:37\n10 Say You Miss Me \tTweedy \t4:07\n11 Sunken Treasure \tTweedy \t6:51\n12 Someday Soon \tTweedy \t2:33\n13 Outta Mind (Outta Sight) \tTweedy \t3:19\n14 Someone Else's Song \tTweedy \t3:20\n15 Kingpin \tTweedy \t5:17\n16 (Was I) In Your Dreams \tTweedy \t3:31\n17 Why Would You Wanna Live \tTweedy \t4:16\n18 The Lonely 1 \tTweedy \t4:44\n19 Dreamer in My Dreams \tTweedy \t6:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:440205c21dba6d9fb9cc231ecfce27c36c73743a","amp;dn":"Wilco+-+1996+-+Being+There+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"440205c21dba6d9fb9cc231ecfce27c36c73743a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,2,5,194,29,186,109,159,185,204,35,30,207,206,39,195,108,115,116,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
