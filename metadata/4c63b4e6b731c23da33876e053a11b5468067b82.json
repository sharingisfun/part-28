Movie stars Kevin Dillon (Johnny Drama from Entourage) and while the plot is very implausible it still has a big nostalgia factor for me personally. This is a retail DVD-rip and not a VHS transfer. Enjoy and please seed.\n\nA team of Navy Seals are sent to destroy a disabled submarine so it will not fall into the &quot;wrong&quot; hands. They complete their mission, but are captured before they can return to their base. The U.S. Government will not mount a rescue mission to free the soldiers, so their teenage children take over. The kids find a way to venture into the foreign country and then must overcome many obstacles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c63b4e6b731c23da33876e053a11b5468067b82","amp;dn":"RARE+Disney+Channel+Movie+-+The+Rescue+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c63b4e6b731c23da33876e053a11b5468067b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,99,180,230,183,49,194,61,163,56,118,224,83,161,27,84,104,6,123,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
