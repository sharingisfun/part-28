Three singles from the album are burning up the radio airwaves as\nanticipation for the album escalates. Birdman's current single, &quot;Money To Blow,&quot;\nfeaturing the vocals of reigning Cash Money superstar Lil Wayne and Young\nMoney's newest red-hot addition Drake, was the No. 1 most added song at Urban\nRadio. Produced by the talented Drumma Boy (Rick Ross, T.I., Fabolous, Plies,\nYoung Jeezy), &quot;Money To Blow&quot; reached over 1 million listeners in its first week\nof release. On a similar trajectory, the banger &quot;Always Strapped,&quot; produced by\nMr. Beatz (Rick Ross, T-Pain &amp; Lil Wayne) reached No. 5 on Urban Radio charts\nand has a combined radio audience of 433 million in Top 40, Crossover, and\nUrban. &quot;Always Strapped&quot; is a Top 10 Ringtone for the Universal Motown Record\nGroup, with 350,000 downloads sold to date.\n\nThe buzz for Priceless continues to rise with new Cash Money signee Jay Sean\nbringing his British sensibility to Birdman's &quot;Written on Her,&quot; which was the\nNo. 1 most added track on Crossover Radio as of August 25th, attracting an\naudience of 8.5 million. &quot;Written on Her,&quot; is No. 22 on the Crossover Charts, is\ngaining momentum with a 40% increase in sales over three weeks. With the release\nof &quot;Pricele$$&quot;, Birdman, a man of considerable talents, answers his first\ncalling -- making hit records -- which he has done time and again, selling 7\nmillion mobile products and with the platinum &quot;Pop Bottles&quot; ringtone. &quot;It's not\nabout showing who has the most swagger,&quot; Birdman says. &quot;That all comes with the\npackage. I'm just being me. But the focus is always great music. I want to\nstretch myself. The overall theme I'm trying to get across with this album is\nlife is priceless. You have to enjoy it. You have to live like it's your last\nday. Live how you feel.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe87e16733e8ffcddeb0bef83b2f6e1f1bcbfd83","amp;dn":"Birdman+-+Priceless+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe87e16733e8ffcddeb0bef83b2f6e1f1bcbfd83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,135,225,103,51,232,255,205,222,176,190,248,59,47,110,31,27,203,253,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
