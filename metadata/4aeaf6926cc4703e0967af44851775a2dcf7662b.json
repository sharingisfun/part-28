Previously many of these moments were too fast or too hidden for us to see. But now new camera technologies reveal what's behind these remarkable moments, and cutting edge animations illustrate the &quot;inside story&quot; of animal bioengineering that allows each moment of impact to take place.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Jungle \nTeeming with creatures in every shape and form, the jungle is the most diverse habitat on the planet and home to nearly half of the world's plant and animal species. Rising hundreds of feet from the dark depths of the tropical forest floor, through layers of twisting branch and canopy full of life - this vertical landscape pushes the limits of animal engineering. The jungle's layers are peeled back to dissect more amazing moments of impact. Stealth and ambush reign in the jungle and survival depends on highly tuned senses and ingenious defences. From ninja ants to flying snakes, cameras dive underwater, sail through trees and penetrate fur, feathers, skin and bone to reveal the science of some amazing animal engineering hidden deep in the jungle.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1714 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 53.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 2\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/moment-of-impact/introduction/5583/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/moment-of-impact/introduction/5583/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aeaf6926cc4703e0967af44851775a2dcf7662b","amp;dn":"PBS+Moment+of+Impact+2of2+Jungle+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aeaf6926cc4703e0967af44851775a2dcf7662b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,234,246,146,108,196,112,62,9,103,175,68,133,23,117,162,220,247,102,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
