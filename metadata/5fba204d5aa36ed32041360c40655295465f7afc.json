The Army's evidence against Sergeant Ellis Cooper, a decorated Vietnam vet, is overwhelming, which isn't surprising since it's all been planted by a quartet of killers whose reason for framing the erstwhile hero isn't revealed until long after they are. The big secret is who set the murderers loose, and in true cliffhanger fashion, Patterson keeps it under wraps until the very end. Meanwhile, his usual blend of action, violence, fast pacing and uninspired-though-serviceable prose prevail, and will probably do so all the way to the top of the bestseller lists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fba204d5aa36ed32041360c40655295465f7afc","amp;dn":"Four+Blind+Mice+-+James+Patterson-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fba204d5aa36ed32041360c40655295465f7afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,186,32,77,90,163,110,211,32,65,54,12,64,101,82,149,70,95,122,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
