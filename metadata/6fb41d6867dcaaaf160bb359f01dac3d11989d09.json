The song, co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno, was originally written during Bowie's studio sessions for the 1995 album Outside but was not released until a rough mix appeared on the soundtrack to the film Showgirls, and was subsequently remade for Earthling. \n\nBowie describes the feelings behind the song:\n\n\nIt's not as truly hostile about Americans as say &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;: it's merely sardonic. I was traveling in Java when [its] first McDonald's went up: it was like, &quot;for fuck's sake.&quot; The invasion by any homogenised culture is so depressing, the erection of another Disney World in, say, Umbria, Italy, more so. It strangles the indigenous culture and narrows expression of life.\n\n\n&quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot; originally appeared as a rough mix on the soundtrack to the film Showgirls (in which the chorus is &quot;I'm afraid of the animals&quot; instead of the later &quot;I'm afraid of Americans&quot;) and was subsequently remade for Earthling. This version and two of the Nine Inch Nails remixes were released on the bonus disc of the Digibook Expanded Edition of Earthling in 2004. The song is sampled for a remix of Company Flow's &quot;Patriotism&quot; when El-P performs it.\n\nA CD single for &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot; was released in the United States. The single did not include the album version of the song; instead, it featured remixes of the track performed by Bowie's former tourmates, Nine Inch Nails, and drum and bass artist Photek. The (V1) mix became more popular than the original version, largely in part of the accompanying video, leading to its appearance on the retrospectives Best of Bowie and Nothing Has Changed.\n\nA Taxi Driver-influenced music video was produced for the &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans (V1)&quot; remix, starring David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor. Directed by Dom and Nic, it features Bowie being stalked through New York City by Jonny, a hostile American, played by Reznor. As Bowie continues to be harassed and becomes more and more paranoid, he witnesses (or imagines he witnesses) random acts of violence perpetrated by citizens on one another Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but their hands are empty, as if holding invisible guns. The video ends with Bowie ducking behind a taxi while Reznor fires an imaginary assault rifle that inflicts severe damage on a vehicle. Bowie awakens later, only to witness Reznor carrying a cross in a procession which mixes imagery reminiscent of the Way of the Cross and Day of the Dead celebrations. The music video premiered on MTV Live, and later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination in 1998 for Best Male Video.\n\n\nDavid Robert Jones (born 8 January 1947), known professionally by his stage name David Bowie, is an English singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, arranger, and actor. He is also a painter and collector of fine art. Bowie has been a major figure in the world of popular music for over four decades, and is renowned as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work. Aside from his musical abilities, he is recognised for his androgynous beauty, which was an iconic element to his image, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nDavid Buckley says of Bowie: &quot;His influence has been unique in popular culture, he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.&quot; In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140 million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time.\n(video does not have any logos and was extracted untouched)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Afraid_of_Americans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Afraid_of_Americans&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAILnaaga&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAILnaaga&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:04:38\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
