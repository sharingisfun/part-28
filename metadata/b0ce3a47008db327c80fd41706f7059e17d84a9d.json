Beck acknowledged the impact of folk on the song, saying &quot;I'd realized that a lot of what folk music is about taking a tradition and reflecting your own time. I knew my folk music would take off, if I put hip-hop beats behind it.&quot;He had also perceived similarities between Delta blues and hip hop, which helped to inspire the song. &quot;Loser&quot; revolves around several recurring musical elements: a slide guitar riff, Stephenson's sitar, the bassline, and a tremolo guitar part.The song's drum track is sampled from a Johnny Jenkins cover of Dr. John's &quot;I Walk on Gilded Splinters&quot; from the 1970 album Ton Ton Macoute!. During the song's break, there is a sample of a line of dialogue from the 1994 Steve Hanft-directed film Kill the Moonlight, which goes &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a driver/IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a winner/Things are gonna change soon, I can feel it&quot;.Hanft and Beck were friends, and Hanft would go on to direct several music videos for Beck, including the video for &quot;Loser&quot;.\n\nLyrics:\nIn the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey\nButane in my veins and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m out to cut the junkie\nWith the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables\nDog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose\nKill the headlights and put it in neutral\nStock car flaminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with a loser and the cruise control\nBabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in reno with the vitamin d\nGot a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat\nSomeone came sayinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m insane to complain\nAbout a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe everything that you breathe\nYou get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve\nSo shave your face with some mace in the dark\nSavinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ all your food stamps and burninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ down the trailer park\n\nYo. cut it.\n\nSoy un perdador\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n\n(double barrel buckshot)\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n\nForces of evil on a bozo nightmare\nBan all the music with a phony gas chamber\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢cuz oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got a weasel and the otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got a flag\nOneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on the pole, shove the other in a bag\nWith the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job\nThe daytime crap of the folksinger slob\nHe hung himself with a guitar string\nA slab of turkey-neck and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hanginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from a pigeon wing\nYou canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t write if you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t relate\nTrade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate\nAnd my time is a piece of wax fallinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on a termite\nwho's chokinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on the splinters\n\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n(get crazy with the cheese whiz)\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n(drive-by body-pierce)\n(yo bring it on down)\nSoooooyy....\n\n?em llik uoy t'nod yhw os ,ybab resol a m'I rodedreP nu yos\n[It's the Chorus backwards]\n\n(IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a driver, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a winner; things are gonna change I can feel it)\n\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n(I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe you)\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n(Nlehh...)\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n(Sprechen Sie Deutsch hier, Baby!)\nSoy un perdedor\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a loser baby, so why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you kill me?\n(know what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sayinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢? )\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ce3a47008db327c80fd41706f7059e17d84a9d","amp;dn":"Beck+-+Loser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ce3a47008db327c80fd41706f7059e17d84a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,206,58,71,0,141,179,39,200,15,212,23,6,247,5,158,23,216,74,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
