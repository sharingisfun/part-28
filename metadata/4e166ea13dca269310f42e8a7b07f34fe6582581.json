While working as an accountant in Lisbon, MacÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio became smitten with the radiant blonde whose window he could spy from his modest office. Her name was Luisa (Catarina Wallenstein), but according to MacÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio's uncle she was well out of the humble accountant's league. Determined to win her love at all costs, MacÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio retreats to Cape Verde and attempts to earn enough money to be considered an acceptable suitor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYear: 2009\nCountry: Portugal/Spain/France\nRuntime: 64 minutes\nDirector: Manoel de Oliveira\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDVDRip (this rip is not mine)\nFormat: AVI\nVideo codec: others MPEG4\nAudio codec: AC3\nVideo: 640 x 384, 25 fps, XviD 1.488kbps\nAudio: MPEG1/2 L3, 108 kbps  48 KHz\nSize: 699.8 MiB\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic\nart in the digital era.
