There are one or two songs that are a little lighter, and the singer uses a softer voice at points, but nevertheless it&amp;#039;s a good album.  If you like Fear Factory and Cannibal Corpse, Brain Drill, Decapitated, or Hatebreed, you&amp;#039;ll enjoy this CD.\n\nDivine Heresy\n\nBleed The Fifth - (2007)\n\n1. Bleed the Fifth\n2.
