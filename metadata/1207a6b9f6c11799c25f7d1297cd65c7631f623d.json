Always somewhat arty and challenging to begin with, SDRE flirts with out-and-out prog rock here, cleaning up the production to reveal the contrasting layers in their ever more intricate arrangements. There's a droning, almost Middle Eastern feel to some of the songs, pointing up Jeremy Enigk's newfound taste for spiritual mysticism. Enigk has matured greatly as a vocalist, applying lessons learned from his solo project; gone is the strangled roar he frequently used on Diary, but even while confirming his softer bent, he's reined in the swooning, bordering-on-fey excess of LP2. Similarly, the band's musicianship keeps getting sharper, handling the twisting chord progressions with an easy grace that keeps the songs flowing smoothly into one another.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1207a6b9f6c11799c25f7d1297cd65c7631f623d","amp;dn":"Sunny+Day+Real+Estate+-+How+It+Feels+%281998%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1207a6b9f6c11799c25f7d1297cd65c7631f623d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,7,166,185,246,193,23,153,194,95,125,18,151,205,101,199,99,31,98,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
