He sees hatred and destruction wrought by every kind of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ there is, and the zealots who kill in their names. Until now, he has always been a part of the solutionÃ¢â‚¬â€however imperfectÃ¢â‚¬â€a part of justice. But when Gil discovers he played a key role in wrongly condemning an innocent man to death row, it shakes his faithÃ¢â‚¬â€in the system, in himself, and in GodÃ¢â‚¬â€deeply. It even estranges him from his wife and son.  \nDesperate, Gil offers up a prayer. To know God is there, not through a sign or physical demonstration but through the strength to cope with his ever-growing, ever-creeping doubts.\nHis problems become more than personal as things heat up in Houston. A serial killer terrorizing the morally righteous turns out to have religious motivations, upping the case from homicide to domestic terrorism. A number of prominent secular icons die or are grievously injured abruptly and under suspicious circumstances, the latest of which is a New Atheist writer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fallen into an inexplicable coma. Left and right, it seems Gil canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape the power of God and murder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8d58dec5379982a95a27ec45c66bc5c1156781","amp;dn":"Philip+Kerr-Prayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8d58dec5379982a95a27ec45c66bc5c1156781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,141,88,222,197,55,153,130,169,90,39,236,69,198,107,197,193,21,103,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
