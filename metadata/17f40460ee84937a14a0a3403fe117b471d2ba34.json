These phenomena signal the rise of a new India, one that is confident, high tech and fully connected to the rest of the world.\nThis book examines how this new globalized India emerged, telling the dramatic story of its economic reforms, influential IT diaspora, software revolution and contribution to the controversial growth or offshore outsourcing.\nThis rise of India is not only transforming the country, it is shaping the economic and cultural realities of the 21st century world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f40460ee84937a14a0a3403fe117b471d2ba34","amp;dn":"India+and+the+IT+revolution%3A+networks+of+global+culture+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f40460ee84937a14a0a3403fe117b471d2ba34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,244,4,96,238,132,147,122,20,160,163,64,63,225,23,180,113,210,186,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
