That being said, 'Sway' is more diverse than ever. The tracks range from the house-inspired 'Pimp Your Hat' and 'Panic in Purple' and the blissful chill out grooves of 'So Many Dynamos' to several straight up banging party-bombs like 'Goas Ark' and 'Mercury Calling (More info for the U.F.O's)'. The theme is still the same though. It's positive, groovy and dance-friendly music with that special Flowjob-sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2befee01b4d850545c0625bbd0cee5132df23bc4","amp;dn":"Flowjob+-+Sway+-+2011+%5BProgressive+Trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2befee01b4d850545c0625bbd0cee5132df23bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,239,238,1,180,216,80,84,92,6,37,187,208,206,229,19,45,242,59,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
