Slowly they reveal themselves to each other, finding that each is a widow/widower. Each is slow to reveal anything personal so that each revelation is hidden by a misperception. They become friends, then close friends, and then she reveals that she can't have a lover because, for her, her husband's memory is still too strong. Much of the film is told wordlessly in action, or through hearing one of their thoughts as they go about their day.\n\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061138/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7683ac314df3d8be2acf0c3b932a441f77b73a2","amp;dn":"A+Man+and+a+Woman+%281966%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7683ac314df3d8be2acf0c3b932a441f77b73a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,104,58,195,20,223,61,139,226,172,240,195,185,50,164,65,247,123,115,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
