There, they found a five-year-old boy lying on the carpet. There were no obvious signs of trauma, but the child, Jacob, died the next day. The story made the headlines and hundreds attended the funeral. Few people were surprised when the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother and her boyfriend went to prison for the crime. Police declared themselves satisfied with the result, saying there was no doubt that justice had been done. And yet, for years rumours swept the estate and clung like cobwebs to the long-vacant house: there had been a cover-up. The real perpetrator, at least according to local gossip, was the boy's six-year-old sister, LaurenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Twenty years on, Lauren has created a new life for herself, but details of JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death begin to resurface and the story again makes the newspapers. As Lauren struggles with the ghosts of her childhood, it seems only a matter of time before the past catches up with her.\n\n\nI Came to Say Goodbye: \nIt was four o'clock in the morning. A young woman pushed through the hospital doors. Staff would later say they thought the woman was a new mother, returning to her child - and in a way, she was. She walked into the nursery, where a baby girl lay sleeping. The infant didn't wake when the woman placed her gently in the shopping bag she had brought with her. There is CCTV footage of what happened next, and most Australians would have seen it, either on the internet or the news. The woman walked out to the car park, towards an old Corolla. For a moment, she held the child gently against her breast and, with her eyes closed, she smelled her. She then clipped the infant into the car, got in and drove off.\nThat is where the footage ends.\nIt isn't where the story ends, however.\nIt's not even where the story starts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75c356435732e13c85169e9e389d44946178e7c2","amp;dn":"Caroline+Overington+-+Ghost+Child+%26amp%3B+I+Came+to+Say+Goodbye%28Ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75c356435732e13c85169e9e389d44946178e7c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,195,86,67,87,50,225,60,133,22,158,158,56,157,68,148,97,120,231,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
