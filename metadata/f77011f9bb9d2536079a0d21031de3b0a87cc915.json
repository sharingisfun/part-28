The West Coast Odd \n      Sox and Bette Davis Cup Squad - Jonathan Biggins, David Marr, Annabel Crabb and     \n      Merrick Watts - battle each other and themselves as they try to tell the difference \n      between baby names and IKEA products. Other things to look out for include: the     \n      casual character assassination of Jamie Oliver and Rupert Murdoch, David and        \n      Jonathan demonstrating the Maroubra stomp and the catchy phrase: 'How long have you \n      two guys been married?'    Randling, created for ABC1 by Andrew Denton and Jon      \n      Casimir, the gentlemen behind The Gruen Transfer, is a game show that hearkens back \n      to the good old days when a point was a point and a team was something worth        \n      barracking for.     Using sporting competition as inspiration and framework,        \n      Randling pits ten amazing teams against each other over 27 rounds of bone-crunching \n      combat. All of it hurtling towards the 2012 Randling Grand Final and the            \n      presentation of a trophy which has cost the ABC so much cash that from next year,   \n      Four Corners will be Three Corners And A Gap.     White-water rafting for the brain,\n      Randling is a show where smart people can be funny and funny people can be smart,   \n      where actual knowledge may help you, but just as likely won't. It's a cheeky,       \n      surprising show that allows Mr Denton to live up to his hosting motto: &quot;I'm Andrew  \n      and I'm not here to help&quot;.                                                          \n   \n     Group Info  \n   \n      Our mission is to provide the scene with decent quality rips of old TV classics.\n   \n      Greets fly out to ARCHiViST, GERUDO, INQUISITION, RedBlade, REWARD, and everyone\n      that helped us; you know who you guys are!\n   \n      Looking for decent affil sites (no rented/colo) and rippers/cappers.\n   \n      Ask around for us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77011f9bb9d2536079a0d21031de3b0a87cc915","amp;dn":"Randling.S01E14.DVDRip.x264-DEiMOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77011f9bb9d2536079a0d21031de3b0a87cc915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,112,17,249,187,157,37,54,7,154,13,33,3,29,227,176,168,124,201,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
