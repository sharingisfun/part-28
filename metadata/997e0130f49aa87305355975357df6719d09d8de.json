Quintet. It has been carefully remastered from the original, analogue source and sounds really great!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:997e0130f49aa87305355975357df6719d09d8de","amp;dn":"The+Medium+-+The+Medium+%281969%2F2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"997e0130f49aa87305355975357df6719d09d8de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,126,1,48,244,154,168,115,5,53,89,117,53,125,246,113,157,9,216,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
