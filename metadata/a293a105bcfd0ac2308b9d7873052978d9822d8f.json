It's a brief departure from the usual battle hackenslash of the other films and instead shows another side to Sharpe's personality, including his terrible intuition when it comes to the pathetic and deceptively fragile Jane.\n\nBut Sharpe isn't the main highlight of this installment. For me, the head attraction is Harper, played by the impressive and easy-on-the-eyes Daragh O'Malley. His revenge on a brutal sargeant with the simple words, &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; is a moment to be cherished and rewatched over and over. Just delicious.\n\nNote:\nI'll be seeding this on 10.01.06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a293a105bcfd0ac2308b9d7873052978d9822d8f","amp;dn":"Sharpe+-+09+-+Sharpe%5C%27s+Regiment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a293a105bcfd0ac2308b9d7873052978d9822d8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,147,161,5,188,253,10,194,48,139,157,120,115,5,41,120,217,130,45,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
