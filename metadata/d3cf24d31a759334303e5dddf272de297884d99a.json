PDF made by me.\n\nNo game has so long and rich a history as chess; more has been written about it than any other game. Curiously, however, little has been written about chesspieces. This profusely illustrated volume explores the evolution and development of the &quot;tools&quot; of the great game from the fifth through the twentieth century. F. Lanier Graham, Assistant Curator, Department of Architecture and Design of The Museum of Morlern Art, provides a history of chess through his discussion of the design and meaning of the pieces, and thus presents a fascinating subject from a new vantage point. Of particular interest is the section on the more important modern sets, which presents Mr. Graham's view that contemporary designs offer a new reality to the ancient and revered game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cf24d31a759334303e5dddf272de297884d99a","amp;dn":"Chess+Sets+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cf24d31a759334303e5dddf272de297884d99a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,207,36,211,26,117,147,52,48,62,93,221,242,114,222,41,120,132,217,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
