The only problem is that he can find neither the time nor the place to enjoy his pastime. At work, his boss has let him know in no uncertain terms that he is not to read during working hours. At home, his shrewish wife won't even let him read a newspaper, let alone a book. One day, he sneaks down to the vault in the bank's basement to read a bit and suddenly, there is a huge explosion above. He emerges to find the world destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. He does find books from the library and he sees a great deal of reading time ahead of him. Except for one small unintended event.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7536c073270806cd4a9ec8c9b87b0c981779365e","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Time+Enough+At+Last","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7536c073270806cd4a9ec8c9b87b0c981779365e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,54,192,115,39,8,6,205,74,158,200,201,184,123,12,152,23,121,54,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
