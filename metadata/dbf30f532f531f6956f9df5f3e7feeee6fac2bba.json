Then I discovered on Demonoid two torrents that were just what I was looking for. One was a rip of the laserdisc release and the other a 2 DVD set of the original broadcast. I took these and the CD and reconstructed the show for this release.\n\nA lot of work went into this one. The original broadcast release was in mono, not the best fidelity, and had a whole lot of digital and analog errors. I cleaned the errors by manually second by second, EQd them to match as best I could, and spatialized them so they didn't stick out so badly. As far as the songs themselves I only used this version for the ones that didn't exist anywhere else, but I used it throughout the show to restore the dialogue between numbers.\n\nThis is now the entire concert. Sources used are the CD &quot;Live In Australia With The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra&quot;, The laserdisc release &quot;Live In Australia&quot;, the &quot;...To Be Continued&quot; box set, and the original broadcast bootleg release. I'm not going to detail which parts I took from which masters, because I didn't write it down as I did it, and that would be very difficult to do in hindsight. The VHS sourced stuff is fairly easy to spot. As for the rest...well you figure it out :)\n\nI also included the single versions of two songs from the box set at the end of the set for the sake of completeness\n\n\n01 Funeral For A Friend\n02 One Horse Town\n03 Rocket Man\n04 The Bitch Is Back\n05 Daniel\n06 Song For Guy\n07 Blue Eyes\n08 I Guess That's Why The Call It The Blues\n09 Bennie &amp; The Jets\n10 band introductions\n11 Heartache All Over The World\n12 Sad Songs (Say So Much)\n13 This Town\n14 I'm Still Standing\n15 Sixty Years On\n16 I Need You To Turn To\n17 The Greatest Discovery\n18 Tonight\n19 Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n20 The King Must Die\n21 Cold As Christmas (In The Middle Of The Year)\n22 Take Me To the Pilot\n23 Carla Etude\n24 Tiny Dancer\n25 Have Mercy On The Criminal\n26 thanking the crew\n27 Slow Rivers\n28 Madman Across The Water\n29 Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\n30 Candle In The Wind\n31 Burn Down The Mission\n32 Your Song\n32 Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\n\n34 Candle In The Wind (single version)\n35 Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me (single version)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf30f532f531f6956f9df5f3e7feeee6fac2bba","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Live+In+Australia+With+The+Melbourne+Symphony+Orche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf30f532f531f6956f9df5f3e7feeee6fac2bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,243,15,83,47,83,31,105,86,249,223,95,62,127,238,238,111,172,43,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
