The 7 (!) singles from this album went all Top 30 in the UK (except 2), and it contains the original version of 'I Want to Live', which is very different from the single version (I am referring to the German edition of this CD). Even though vocalist Dominique Atkins didn't originally sang 'NOT OVER YET', she does a good job on the album, which has only 2 songs which are not so good. If you are lucky enough to find the single releases you will find remixes that will haunt you, like almost every remix of 'Down to Earth', BT's Spirit of Grace ('Not Over Yet'), 'Hand in Hand' (Jam El Mar Remix, of Jam&amp;Spoon), 'If I Could Fly' (though the only non-drum&amp;bass remix is the Perfecto one), and all remixes on the (re)issue 'You're Not Mine/Down to Earth'. Also check out all of BT's works, other Grace collaboration on the Ministry of Sound Trace Nation (1) (track No.9 on CD1 - 'Invisible') and those Trance Nation compilations (M.O.S.), and procuction/remixes by Paul Oakenfold/Steve osborne like the remix of Olive's 'You're Not Alone'!
