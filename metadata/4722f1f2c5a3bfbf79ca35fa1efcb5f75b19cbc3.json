Even though Apple created iPhone as a closed device, tens of thousands of developers bought them with the expressed purpose of designing and running third-party software. In this clear and concise book, veteran hacker Jonathan Zdziarski ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the original hackers of the iPhone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains the iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s native environment and how you can build software for this device using its Objective-C, C, and C++ development frameworks.\n\niPhone Open Application Development walks you through the iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proprietary development environment, offers an overview of the Objective-C language youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll use with it, and supplies background for the iPhone operating system. You also get detailed recipes and working examples for everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favorite iPhone features ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ graphics and audio programming, interfaces for adding multitouch functionality to games, the use of hardware sensors, and the deviceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vast user interface kit. This book explains: How to access the iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s underlying operating system The makeup of an iPhone application How to get the open source tool chain running on your desktop The iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s core user interface framework, which is heavily tied to major application-level functions Using the many touted iPhone features such as multitouch, hardware sensors, and gestures Intercepting and handling event notifications for many iPhone-related events Raw video surfaces and 3D transformations that take you deeper into advanced graphics on the iPhone How to record and play simple sounds and intercept sound events Advanced digital audio output using AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new Audio Toolbox framework Advanced user interfacecomponents such as section lists, keyboards, and image manipulation The Appendix includes a compendium of miscellaneous code examples for cool application features, such as using the camera and creating a CoverFlow(R)-like album browser. This book is a true hackerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book, designed for the millions of users who have run third party applications on their iPhone, but its concepts and code examples have shown to be remarkably similar to AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official SDK, making this book a valuable resource for both camps. Any programmer can use this book to write applications with the same spectacular effects that made the device an immediate hit, and impress users just as much as the official iPhone software does. That programmer can easily be you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4722f1f2c5a3bfbf79ca35fa1efcb5f75b19cbc3","amp;dn":"iPhone+Open+Application+Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4722f1f2c5a3bfbf79ca35fa1efcb5f75b19cbc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,34,241,242,197,163,191,191,121,202,53,250,30,252,181,247,91,25,203,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
