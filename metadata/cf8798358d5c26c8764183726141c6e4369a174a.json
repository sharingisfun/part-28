The Black Velvet Band is an Irish quartet led by singer/songwriter/guitarist Kieran Kennedy, also featuring singer Maria Doyle, bassist Shay Fitzgerald, and drummer/vocalist Dave Horner. \n\nThe music is well mastered and has a light Indie music sound you will find available today but this album was released in 1992. I tried to find another band to compare this music to but found it hard to bring to mind something to offer in this review. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8798358d5c26c8764183726141c6e4369a174a","amp;dn":"The+Black+Velvet+Band...King+of+Myself%281992%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8798358d5c26c8764183726141c6e4369a174a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,135,152,53,141,92,38,200,118,65,131,114,97,65,198,228,54,154,23,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
