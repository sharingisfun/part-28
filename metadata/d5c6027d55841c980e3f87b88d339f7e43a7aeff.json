DreyerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Passion of Joan of Arc convinced the world that movies could be art. RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Falconetti gives one of the greatest performances ever recorded on film, as the young maiden who died for God and France. Long thought to have been lost to fire, the original version was miraculously found in perfect condition in 1981ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in a Norwegian mental institution. Criterion is proud to present this milestone of silent cinema in a new special edition featuring composer Richard EinhornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Voices of Light, an original opera/oratorio inspired by the film.\n\nCast\nJeanne\t\t   RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Falconetti\nPierre Cauchon\t   EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Silvain\nJean dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Estivet\t   AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Berley\nNicolas Loyseleur  Maurice Schutz\nJean Massieu\t   Antonin Artaud\nJean LemaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®tre\t   Gilbert Dalleu\nN. de Houppeville  Jean dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Yd\nJean BeaupÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\t   Louis Ravet\n\nCredits\nDirector\t   Carl Th.
