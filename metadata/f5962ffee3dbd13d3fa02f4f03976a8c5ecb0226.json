But if a man forges a cheque, or sets his house on fire, or robs with violence from the person, or does any other such things as are criminal in our own country, he is either taken to a hospital and most carefully tended at the public expense, or if he is in good circumstances, he lets it be known to all his friends that he is suffering from a severe fit of immorality, just as we do when we are ill, and they come and visit him with great solicitude.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nErewhon, or Over the Range is a novel by Samuel Butler, published anonymously in 1872. The title is also the name of a country, supposedly discovered by the protagonist. In the novel, it is not revealed in which part of the world Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a fictional country. Butler meant the title to be read as the word Nowhere backwards, even though the letters Ã¢â‚¬Å“hÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“wÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are transposed. It is likely that he did this to protect himself from accusations of being unpatriotic, although Erewhon is obviously a satire of Victorian society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5962ffee3dbd13d3fa02f4f03976a8c5ecb0226","amp;dn":"Erewhon+by+Samuel+Butler+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5962ffee3dbd13d3fa02f4f03976a8c5ecb0226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,150,47,254,227,219,209,61,63,160,47,79,3,151,106,140,94,203,2,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
