It started when Johnny Ramone was confronted with the idea of a tribute album and was asked if he wanted to participate, to which he agreed, as long as he would have full control over the project. He was able to get Rob Zombie as a co-producer, and call upon different bands to participate. Rob Zombie also did the cover artwork, and Stephen King, a Ramones fan, wrote the liner notes.\n\nOne of the last things Johnny Ramone did was oversee the album. He told all the chosen bands to do a version totally unlike the Ramones originals. Johnny liked the Red Hot Chili Peppers\\&amp;#039; cover of \\&quot;Havana Affair\\&quot; so much that he chose to open the album with it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79e96c1faf0d01cd11db2ff3870e574e00153d29","amp;dn":"We%5C%27re+a+Happy+Family+-+A+Tribute+to+Ramones+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79e96c1faf0d01cd11db2ff3870e574e00153d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,233,108,31,175,13,1,205,17,219,47,243,135,14,87,78,0,21,61,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
