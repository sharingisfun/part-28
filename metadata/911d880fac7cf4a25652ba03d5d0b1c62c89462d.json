Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as &quot;the hacker ethic,&quot; that still thrives today\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911d880fac7cf4a25652ba03d5d0b1c62c89462d","amp;dn":"Hackers%3A+Heroes+of+the+Computer+Revolution+-+25th+Anniversary+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911d880fac7cf4a25652ba03d5d0b1c62c89462d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,29,136,15,172,124,244,162,86,82,186,3,213,208,177,198,44,137,70,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
