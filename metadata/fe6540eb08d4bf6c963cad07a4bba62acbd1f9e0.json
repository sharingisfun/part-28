The Ripper has been running amok in the Whitechapel district murdering and dissecting prostitutes. Scotland Yard Inspector Fred Abberline, aided by his partner, Peter Godley, are on the case to figure out who this serial killer is and why he is killing these women in such a brutal manner. Abberline is an opium addict and when &quot;chasing the dragon&quot; he is able to have visions of the future, a certain psychic ability that allows him to solve cases. As Abberline and Godley investigate the crimes, they become acquainted with the prostitutes who were friends and colleagues of the victims. Abberline begins to fall in love with Mary Kelly, one of the prostitutes, or as the nobles called them &quot;unfortunates&quot;, being hunted down by Jack the Ripper. Abberline digs deeper and deeper into the conspiracy and attempts to solve the case before Mary Kelly is the next victim\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAVI File\n\nWidth: 640\nHight: 360\nFramerate: 25 f/ps\nAudio: 128 kbps\nLength: 01:57:03\nGenre: Thriller\nTagline: Only the legend will survive\n\n\n\nDirector:\n\n* Albert Hughes\n\n\nCast:\n\n* Johnny Depp\n* Heather Graham\n* Ian Holm\n* Ian Richardson\n* Robbie Coltrane\n* Katrin Cartlidge\n* Lesley Sharp\n* Joanna Page\n* Susan Lynch\n\n\nTrailer:\n\nTrailer (Flash) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.dtrailer.com/movies/watch/from-hell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.dtrailer.com/movies/watch/from-hell&lt;/a&gt;\nTrailer (Windows Media Player) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw8US3gS37w&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw8US3gS37w&lt;/a&gt;\nTrailer (Quicktime) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/from_hell/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/from_hell/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\nIMDB User Rating: 6.8/10 (38,027 votes) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Dutch downloaders I enclosed the correct subtitles for this movie in an .SRT file which will be in synch the whole movie.
