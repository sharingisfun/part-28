Thanx for the ups bro.\n\nHi Infidelity is the ninth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1980. It went on to become the biggest selling rock LP of 1981, eventually selling over ten million copies. Six songs from this album hit Billboard charts, including &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; which was the band's first Number 1 hit, and &quot;Take It on the Run&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the charts. The album title is a play on the term Hi-Fi (high fidelity), and the album art is an illustration of this pun where an act of sexual infidelity is occurring while the man is putting a record LP to play on the hi-fi stereo.\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
