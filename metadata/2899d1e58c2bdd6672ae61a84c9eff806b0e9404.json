Bard, &quot;Algebraic Cryptanalysis&quot; \n Sp,,..er | 2009 | ISBN: 0387887563 | 392 pages | PDF | 1.73 MB \n\n Algebraic Cryptanalysis bridges the gap between a course in cryptography, and being able to read the cryptanalytic literature. This book is divided into three parts: Part One covers the process of turning a cipher into a system of equations; Part Two covers finite field linear algebra; Part Three covers the solution of Polynomial Systems of Equations, with a survey of the methods used in practice, including SAT-solvers and the methods of Nicolas Courtois.\n\n Algebraic Cryptanalysis is designed for advanced-level students in computer science and mathematics as a secondary text or reference book for self-guided study. This book is suitable for researchers in Applied Abstract Algebra or Algebraic Geometry who wish to find more applied topics or practitioners working for security and communications companies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2899d1e58c2bdd6672ae61a84c9eff806b0e9404","amp;dn":"Algebraic+Cryptanalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2899d1e58c2bdd6672ae61a84c9eff806b0e9404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,153,209,229,140,43,221,102,114,174,97,168,76,158,255,128,107,14,148,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
