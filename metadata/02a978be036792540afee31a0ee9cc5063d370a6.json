Although Avalon isn't its equal, it's nevertheless one of his very best works, featuring cool, measured performances from Tesh and a pleasingly trancy set of songs that will appeal to any fan of Red Rocks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02a978be036792540afee31a0ee9cc5063d370a6","amp;dn":"John+Tesh+-+Avalon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02a978be036792540afee31a0ee9cc5063d370a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,169,120,190,3,103,146,84,10,254,227,26,14,233,204,80,99,211,112,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
