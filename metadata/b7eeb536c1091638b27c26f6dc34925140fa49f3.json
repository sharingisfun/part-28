Musically, Farren described their sound as &quot;teeth-grinding, psychedelic rock&quot; somewhere between the Stooges and The Mothers of Invention. The Deviants have been described as a transition between classic British psych and the Punk/Heavy Metal aesthetic of the 1970s. They were the first act to ever be introduced as a Punk rock band by the underground DJ Jeff Dexter at Tiles Club in LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Oxford Street, August 15 1967.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n   1. &quot;Opening&quot; (Bishop/Farren/Hunter/Rees/Sparkes)\n   2. &quot;I'm Coming Home&quot; (Bishop/Farren/Hunter)\n   3. &quot;Child of the Sky&quot; (Farren/Rees/Hammond)\n   4. &quot;Charlie&quot; (Bishop/Farren)\n   5. &quot;Nothing Man&quot; (Farren/Moore)\n   6. &quot;Garbage&quot; (Bishop/Farren/Hunter)\n   7. &quot;Bun&quot; (Rees)\n   8. &quot;Deviation Street&quot; (Farren)\n\nBitrate: 224kbps\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deviants_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deviants_(band)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7eeb536c1091638b27c26f6dc34925140fa49f3","amp;dn":"The+Deviants+-+Ptooff+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7eeb536c1091638b27c26f6dc34925140fa49f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,238,181,54,193,9,22,56,178,124,38,246,220,52,146,81,64,250,73,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
