Instead, they are said to dive deep below the world's waters as USOs-unidentified submerged objects.\n  \nUFO FILES plunges into the Santa Catalina Channel near Los Angeles to search for evidence of a 1992 USO event.  \n\nNext, probe the paranormal history of the USS FDR, which was at the center of at least eight major sightings in its two-decade career.  \n\nThen it's off to Australia to examine famed Tully Water-Crop Circle Case. Guides for this journey include USS FDR veterans Chet Gruisinsky and Harry Jordan, USO researcher Dr. Stephen Greer, and Australian UFO expert Bill Chaulker.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb403/Greg94501/Picture.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c34af7837228b9b466da24835e3d7e31dba23b","amp;dn":"Deep+Sea+UFO%27s+-+Red+Alert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c34af7837228b9b466da24835e3d7e31dba23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,195,74,247,131,114,40,185,180,102,218,36,131,94,61,126,49,219,162,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
