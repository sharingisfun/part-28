But the death of her doting guardian leaves Gemma under the care of her resentful aunt, and it soon becomes clear that she is nothing more than an unwelcome guest at Yew House. When she receives a scholarship to a private school, ten-year-old Gemma believes she's found the perfect solution and eagerly sets out again to a new home. However, at Claypoole she finds herself treated as an unpaid servant.\n\nTo Gemma's delight, the school goes bankrupt, and she takes a job as an au pair on the Orkney Islands. The remote Blackbird Hall belongs to Mr. Sinclair, a London businessman; his eight-year-old niece is Gemma's charge. Even before their first meeting, Gemma is, like everyone on the island, intrigued by Mr. Sinclair. Rich (by Gemma's standards), single, flying in from London when he pleases, Hugh Sinclair fills the house with life. An unlikely couple, the two are drawn to each other, but Gemma's biggest trial is about to begin: a journey of passion and betrayal, redemption and discovery, that will lead her to a life of which she's never dreamed.\n\nSet in Scotland and Iceland in the 1950s and '60s, The Flight of Gemma HardyÃ¢â‚¬â€a captivating homage to Charlotte BrontÃƒâ€¹'s Jane EyreÃ¢â‚¬â€is a sweeping saga that resurrects the timeless themes of the original but is destined to become a classic all its own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ad97d462d8e0587d4e12e3eec9a45372453f33","amp;dn":"Margot+Livesey+-+The+Flight+of+Gemma+Hardy+%28Iradins%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ad97d462d8e0587d4e12e3eec9a45372453f33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,173,151,212,98,216,224,88,125,78,18,227,238,201,164,83,114,69,63,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
