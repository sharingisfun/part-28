Three races.  The place isn't big enough for all of them.\n\nThe sexy Sea Reapers use magic and cunning to their advantage in their\nattempts to rid the island of the other races.  Kabuto, the &quot;lumbering\nmountain of pain&quot; uses only brute force and raw savagery in combat.\nFinally, the clever Meccs have as their ally technological advances\nbeyond the imagination which they use to defend themselves and in their\nefforts to claim the island as their own.\n\nGiants brings together real-time-strategy and action gaming elements in\na mix nobody has ever seen before.  The gorgeous graphics and depth of\ngameplay are sure to make this title a smash hit for the holidays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:637c068b363f361b9f34a8275e22fc75952280bd","amp;dn":"Giants_Citizen_Kabuto-Razor1911","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"637c068b363f361b9f34a8275e22fc75952280bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,124,6,139,54,63,54,27,159,52,168,39,94,34,252,117,149,34,128,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
