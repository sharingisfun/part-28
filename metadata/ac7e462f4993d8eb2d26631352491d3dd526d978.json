Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nShort book of profound prayers; reminiscent of St. Augustine.\n\nDescription:\n\nOne of the classics of modern spirituality, Encounters with Silence is one of Karl Rahner's most lucid and powerful books. A book of meditations about man's relation with God, it is not a work of dry theology, but rather a book of prayerful reflections on love, knowledge, and faith, obedience, everyday routines, life with our friends and neighbors, our work and vocation, and human goodness. The immense success of this moving work is a tribute to its practicality and the ability of the great theologian to speak simply and yet profoundly to ordinary men and women seeking an inspiring guide to the inner life, one that never forsakes the world of reality. The book is cast in the form of a dialogue with God that moves from humble but concerned inquiry to joyful contemplation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac7e462f4993d8eb2d26631352491d3dd526d978","amp;dn":"Karl+Rahner+-+Encounters+with+Silence+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac7e462f4993d8eb2d26631352491d3dd526d978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,126,70,47,73,147,216,235,45,38,99,19,82,73,29,61,213,38,217,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
