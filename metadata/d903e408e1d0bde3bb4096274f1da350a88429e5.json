They were not solely responsible for devising folk-rock, \nbut they were certainly more responsible than any other single act \n(Dylan included) for melding the innovations and energy of the \nBritish Invasion with the best lyrical and musical elements of \ncontemporary folk music. The jangling, 12-string guitar sound of \nleader Roger McGuinn's Rickenbacker was permanently absorbed into the \nvocabulary of rock. They also played a vital role in pioneering \npsychedelic rock and country-rock, the unifying element being their \nangelic harmonies and restless eclecticism. \n\nReview by Stephen Thomas Erlewine allmusic.com\n\nForget about a career retrospective -- it's impossible to summarize \nthe Byrds' hits in ten songs. Nevertheless, the budget-line \ncollection Super Hits does a nice job of rounding up the group's hits \n-- including &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!,&quot; &quot;Eight Miles \nHigh,&quot; and &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star&quot; -- plus a handful \nof cult favorites (&quot;Chestnut Mare,&quot; &quot;He Was a Friend of Mine&quot;) on one \naffordable compilation. It's far from definitive or necessarily \nrepresentative -- several phases of the band's evolution are missing \n-- but it may be of interest to casual fans on a strict budget.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.
