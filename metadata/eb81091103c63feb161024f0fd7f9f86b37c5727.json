Measured in terms of mortality, the Great Irish Potato Famine was the worst disasters in the nineteenth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€it claimed twice as many lives as the American Civil War. A perfect storm of bacterial infection, political greed, and religious intolerance sparked this catastrophe. But even more extraordinary than its scope were its political underpinnings, and The Graves Are Walking provides fresh material and analysis on the role that BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nation-building policies played in exacerbating the devastation by attempting to use the famine to reshape Irish society and character. Religious dogma, anti-relief sentiment, and racial and political ideology combined to result in an almost inconceivable disaster of human suffering.\n\nThis is ultimately a story of triumph over perceived destiny: for fifty million Americans of Irish heritage, the saga of a broken people fleeing crushing starvation and remaking themselves in a new land is an inspiring story of revival.\n\nBased on extensive research and written with novelistic flair, The Graves Are Walking draws a portrait that is both intimate and panoramic, that captures the drama of individual lives caught up in an unimaginable tragedy, while imparting a new understanding of the famine's causes and consequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb81091103c63feb161024f0fd7f9f86b37c5727","amp;dn":"John+Kelly+-+The+Graves+Are+Walking+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb81091103c63feb161024f0fd7f9f86b37c5727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,129,9,17,3,198,63,235,22,16,36,240,253,127,159,134,179,124,87,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
