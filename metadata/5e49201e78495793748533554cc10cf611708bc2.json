Bond Ravi is a karate champ and is shown as working in a medical camp of Singapore. He meets Meera (Priyamani) in a bus and falls in love with her charm. One day, Meera visits the same village where Bond Ravi lives to make a documentary film. She stays with her friend Divya (Nidhi Subbaiah). Love with Meera increases for Ravi when Meera is about to leave the village, she tells him to make something big in life. Ravi along with Chapathi Babu (Rangayana Raghu) leaves his village. On the way he meets a military guy Chandrakanth (Avinash), who mistakes the identity of Bond Ravi in the forest. The military guy has come to treat the pain of an army official, Chandrakanth. Now, a sudden shoot begins from Charlie (Jackie Shroff). Bond Ravi helps Chandrakanth in this place. Dreaded personality and drug mafia is looking for his daughter, who thinks his daughter is with Chandrakanth. Next part of the movie is the revenge story of Charlie on Bond Ravi. Charlie on hunting for his daughter kills his daughter, Divya. ChandrakanthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter Meera comes under the custody of Charlie as a part of revenge.The remaining movie revolves around the escape of Meera from Charlie, which is a great task for Bond Ravi.[/b][/quote] \n\n[quote][b]Directed : Duniya Soori\nProduced : Parvathamma Rajkumar\nWritten : Duniya Soori\nStarring : Puneeth Rajkumar, Nidhi Subbaiah, Priyamani, Jackie Shroff\nMusic : V.
