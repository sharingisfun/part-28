Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies. Acts of adultery and other personal betrayals, financial fraud, government corruptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even murder and genocideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½generally require an additional moral defect: a willingness to lie.\n\nIn Lying, bestselling author and neuroscientist Sam Harris argues that we can radically simplify our lives and improve society by merely telling the truth in situations where others often lie. He focuses on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ liesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½those lies we tell for the purpose of sparing people discomfortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for these are the lies that most often tempt us. And they tend to be the only lies that good people tell while imagining that they are being good in the process.\n\n    This essay is quite brilliant. (I was hoping it would be, so I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to lie.) I honestly loved it from beginning to end. LYING is the most thought-provoking read of the year.\n\n    Ricky Gervais\n\n    Humans have evolved to lie well, and no doubt youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen the social lubrication at work.  In many cases, we might not think of it as a true ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: perhaps a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhite lieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ once in a blue moon, the omission of a sensitive detail here and there, false encouragement of others when we see no benefit in dashing someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hopes, and the list goes on. In LYING, Sam Harris demonstrates how to benefit from being brutallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but pragmaticallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½honest.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a compelling little book with a big impact.\n\n    Tim Ferriss, angel investor and author of the #1 New York Times bestsellers, The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek\n\n    In this brief but illuminating work, Sam Harris applies his characteristically calm and sensible logic to a subject that affects us allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the human capacity to lie. And by the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end, Harris compels you to lead a better life because the benefits of telling the truth far outweigh the cost of liesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to yourself, to others, and to society.\n\n    Neil deGrasse Tyson, Astrophysicist, American Museum of Natural History\n\n\nLYING has been published exclusively as a Kindle Single edition.
