You cannot even purchase it outside the US on Amazon. Well, here it is.\n\nDormi Jesu by Vladimir Godar, for SATB choir, soprano voice and piano. Performed by some choir of Cambridge (or Oxford) University, as far as I can remember (I downloaded it by chance some years ago. Lucky me!). The quality of sound is good and the performance is outstanding.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!!!\n\nYou cannot find this anywhere else! At least I couldn't.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2072ee903c2beef054fc071b8d7fd551f86904e3","amp;dn":"Vladimir+Godar+-+Dormi+Jesu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2072ee903c2beef054fc071b8d7fd551f86904e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,114,238,144,60,43,238,240,84,252,7,27,141,127,213,81,248,105,4,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
