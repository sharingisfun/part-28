Maps\nrange from orbital military installations and subterranean ruins to\nfloating islands and futuristic cities.\n\nFormidable Opposition   Battle against nine different enemy types across\nthree different classes each with a strength and weakness against\ncertain tower types requiring careful thought on tower placement.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
