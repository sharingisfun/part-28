All the Way to Heaven: The Selected Letters of Dorothy Day (Robert Ellsberg, ed.) Doubleday, 2012.\n\ndescription: \n\n&quot;The publication of the letters of Dorothy Day is a significant event in the history of Christian spirituality.&quot; - Jim Martin, SJ, author of *My Life with the Saints*\n\nDorothy Day, cofounder of the Catholic Worker movement, has been called the most significant, interesting, and influential person in the history of American Catholicism. Now the publication of her letters, previously sealed for 25 years after her death and meticulously selected by Robert Ellsberg, reveals an extraordinary look at her daily struggles, her hopes, and her unwavering faith.\n\nThis volume, which extends from the early 1920s until the time of her death in 1980, offers a fascinating chronicle of her response to the vast changes in America, the Church, and the wider world. Set against the backdrop of the Depression, World War II, the Cold War, Vatican II, Vietnam, and the protests of the 1960s and '70s, she corresponded with a wide range of friends, colleagues, family members, and well-known figures such as Thomas Merton, Daniel Berrigan, CÃƒÂ©sar Chavez, Allen Ginsberg, Katherine Anne Porter, and Francis Cardinal Spellman, shedding light on the deepest yearnings of her heart. At the same time, the first publication of her early love letters to Forster Batterham highlight her humanity and poignantly dramatize the sacrifices that underlay her vocation.\n\n&quot;These letters are life-, work-, and faith-affirming.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - *National Catholic Reporter*\n\n\n\n2. The Duty of Delight: The Diaries of Dorothy Day (Robert Ellsberg, ed.) Doubleday, 2008.\n\ndescription:\n\nFor almost fifty years, through her tireless service to the poor and her courageous witness for peace, Dorothy Day offered an example of the gospel in action. Now the publication of her diaries, previously sealed for twenty-five years after her death, offers a uniquely intimate portrait of her struggles and concerns.\n\nBeginning in 1934 and ending in 1980, these diaries reflect her response to the vast changes in America, the Church, and the wider world. Day experienced most of the great social movements of her time but, as these diaries reveal, even while she labored for a transformed world, she simultaneously remained grounded in everyday human life: the demands of her extended Catholic worker family; her struggles to be more patient and charitable; the discipline of prayer and worship that structured her days; her efforts to find God in all the tasks and encounters of daily life. \n\nA story of faithful striving for holiness and the radical transformation of the world, Day's life challenges readers to imagine what it would be like to live as if the gospels were true.\n\n&quot;The Duty of Delight is indispensable reading for anyone who cares deeply about God, about the world, or about humanity--in other words for anyone who wishes to learn how to love.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œJames Martin, SJ, author of The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything\n\n&quot;These diaries, and the splendid work of the editor, are a gift to each of us. Instead of simply talking about justice, peace, the poor, the reader is invited to encounter the reality of each situation, event, and person with a mentor and a guide who can be trusted to shine the necessary light which illumines: Dorothy Day. The ordinariness of her life speaks to the extraordinary power of grace in action.&quot;  - Catholic Press Association \n\n&quot;To read these diaries is to enter the world of Dorothy Day, to see that world as she did, and to hear firsthand her conversations with herself and God. The reader is privileged to be invited into this intimate dialogue. . .. Dorothy DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life speaks for itself, and here in these diaries it speaks loudest of all, confirming what she believed: Duty expressed in love gives joy and delight.&quot;  - National Catholic Reporter\n \n&quot;Dorothy Day is perhaps the most significant figure in Western Christianity during the twentieth century. And there is no greater caretaker of these personal scrap-notes and journals than Robert Ellsberg. This book is bound to become a classic, just as Dorothy has become a legend. But let us not forget, Dorothy's famous line:\n'DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t call us saints ... we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be dismissed that easily.' She was just as ordinary as she was radical, and that is part of her charm. Let her life disturb and inspire youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ not to become her Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but to become you.&quot; - Shane Claiborne, activist, founding member of The Simple Way, and author of The Irresistible Revolution\n\n&quot;These diaries embody DorothyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful conviction, lived over many decades, that true holiness is found in the most ordinary aspects of our daily life, and that grace is always present in the midst of struggle. The deeply human side of Dorothy that comes alive in these pages is a sign of great hope for all of us who seek to live a faith-filled life in a complex world.&quot;  - Sr. Mary Scullion, RSM, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Project H.O.M.E.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDorothy Day (1897 - 1980) was an American journalist, social activist and devout Catholic convert. In 1933, with Peter Maurin, she established the Catholic Worker, creating a community dedicated to direct aid for the poor and homeless, solidarity with the dispossessed, and social change. Day participated in the labor struggles of the 1930s, the Civil Rights movement, and nonviolent, pacifist opposition to WWII, Vietnam and Cold War militarism, and her cause for canonization is open in the Catholic Church.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f7b060c19cffa9cb35d5cfa2c2b80a86c3b4c9e","amp;dn":"Dorothy+Day+-+Letters+and+Journals+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f7b060c19cffa9cb35d5cfa2c2b80a86c3b4c9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,123,6,12,25,207,250,156,179,93,92,250,44,43,128,168,108,59,76,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
