This one features some great demos from the early days of the band when they were known as Hybrid Theory just after Chester joined. Other stand outs include some early demos of In The End and Esaul (A Place For My Head Demo) which have been highly sought after by die hard Linkin Park fans. The song Blue also features a vocal melody that would later be re-written and become the chorus for the hit single Crawling.\n\n\n1. YO (MTM Demo) 2:44\n2.
