Later, &quot;Brainstorm on the U.D.S.&quot; alternates rap verses with a punky shoutalong chorus, while &quot;The Devil&quot; borrows a murky string bassline and greasy slide guitar from the Tom Waits bag. Rudeboy never really sings; rather, he raps or -- when the song demands it -- sort of chants along in a singsong cadence. But for a non-singer he has a great voice, one that comes from the chest but has a sharp enough edge to cut through the mix. Also notable are polymath guitarist Tres Manos and the unbelievably funky bass of Silly Sil. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n\n01. Fast Lane\n02. No Kid\n03. Deeper Shade Of Soul\n04. Prayer For My Demo\n05.
