So make sure you check the date on the bottom of the console you should be able to find the manfacture date, in fine print if you still have the sticker attached).\n\n\nCompressed with WinRaR. Tested on a DC Console and works...except for music.\n\nNote: you can extract winrar formats with 7-Zip, 7-Zip is free.\n\nCompressed to small size but everything is there for ya.\n\nNote: There is a small problem with the game the music doesn't work. This seems\nto be a problem with quite a few release's of DC games with cdda that were ripped.\nYou will probably hear an annoying clicking sound to remedy this just turn the \nmusic volume all the way down in the in-game option menu. Some people have \nreleased release's that have the music problem fixed in cdda games, but I don't\nknow how to do this or fix it. Believe me If I knew how I would, all the other\nin game sounds work fine though.\n\nSuzuki Alstare Extreme Racing is already well around the internet but every version seemed to be the non-selfboot. And I wanted to upload the selfboot version so you don't have to mess around getting out that utopia disc every time you play this game.\n\nGame Description:\n\nSuzuki Alstare Extreme Racing is the sequel to Redline Racer. \nIt now features an official Suzuki Alstare Racing Team license.\n\nIt's an arcade superbike racing game. Game modes include Main Game, Reverse Challenge and Single Race.  In Main Game you have to have to compete in challenges to earn a place in the Suzuki Alstare Racing Team. Reverse Challenge is the same but with mirrored circuits.\n\n\nGame Pics included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% (Included in download) or Discjuggler. \n\nSet Burn Settings to Raw/Dao for Alcohol 120% or Raw write Mode 2 2352 CD-DA for Discjuggler, or Mode 1 2048 Raw Write if that doesn't work.\n\nAny DC Games that you burn make sure you allow overburning option in Alcohol or discjuggler, if your burner supports it.\n\nBurn at slowest speed possible for compatibility.\n\n\nBest recommended CD Discs to burn this DC game are Tayio Yuden, or Verbatim.\n\nVerbatim is properly your best bet and should work just fine. \n\n\nIf you come across problems or have questions, please post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I cant't seed 24/7 do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53eb2b51e4fbb9da35b0b6a5b7da86cdea3acb6f","amp;dn":"%5BDC%5D+Suzuki+Alstare+Extreme+Racing+%5BSelf-Boot%5D+%5BNTSC%5D+%5BCDI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53eb2b51e4fbb9da35b0b6a5b7da86cdea3acb6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,235,43,81,228,251,185,218,53,176,182,165,183,218,134,205,234,58,203,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
