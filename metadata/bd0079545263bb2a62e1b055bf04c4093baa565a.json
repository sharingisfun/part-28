Their destination: the Earth. Their purpose: to make it their world. David Vincent has seen them. For him, it began one lost night on a lonely country road, looking for a shortcut that he never found. It began with a closed, deserted diner, and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey. It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy. Now David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here, that they have taken human form. Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh tension, mystery, and paranoia flavor this series, which in some ways anticipates the same feel of the more recent The X-Files. The series kicks into high gear in the first episode: as the opening narration alludes to, David Vincent is lost on a country road at night, and pulls over to take a nap next to â€œBudâ€™s Diner.â€ He awakes to see a classic flying saucer land nearby. Naturally, no-one believes him, the roadside hashhouse has become â€œKellyâ€™s Dinerâ€, and a honeymooning couple in a camper nearby state that they were there all night, had been awake and getting ready to go fishing at the precise time Vincent says he was there and saw the saucer, and saw neither flying saucer nor Vincent and his car. A small physical clue which Vincent (and the audience) quickly discover, a defect in the fingers is the giveaway of most of these human-disguised aliens. But . . . some of them do not have this flaw. After involuntary hospitalization and an attempt on his life, Vincent drops out to pursue these alien invaders â€“ but neither he, nor we, can be sure who can be trusted.\r\n\r\nThis series also prefigures (and may have inspired to some degree) the slightly later British series UFO. Both offer the same theme of aliens quietly invading Earth, with most of Mankind unaware of their presence. In neither series are the aims of the aliens entirely clear: The Invaders are introduced as fleeing a dying planet, but exactly what it is they are doing is a mystery; the UFO aliens seem less interested in invasion than in harvesting human bodies. Both offer a degree of paranoia, and both invoke the specter of entirely human fellow travelers. The opening sequence of The Invaders, with the panorama of planets, resembles UFOâ€™s closing sequence. \r\n\r\nThere is a bit of ambiguity as to what degree The Invaders was meant as an ikon of Cold War fears. One analysis suggests that producer Quinn Martin simply wanted a show which could emulate the motif of The Fugitive (which, with Dr. Kimball, had just ended its run), with a lone man always on the move for some reason, giving us a new locale and mostly new characters every week. Like The Fugitive, the episodes are presented in a series of â€œActsâ€, with an â€œEpilogâ€ to conclude. \r\nIn retrospect, it is easy to assume that the Cold War colored much of the popular psyche, intentionally or not. On the other hand, even Freud said that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; perhaps sometimes alien invaders are just alien invaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nComprehensive episode guide follows in complete torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0079545263bb2a62e1b055bf04c4093baa565a","amp;dn":"The+Invaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0079545263bb2a62e1b055bf04c4093baa565a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,0,121,84,82,99,187,42,98,225,176,85,191,4,196,9,59,170,86,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
