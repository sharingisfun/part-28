Newton. There&amp;#039;s no pretense of objectivity -- the Black Panther Party shared in the copyright. Speakers at the rally included Bobby Seale, Stokely Carmichael, and H. Rap Brown, and there&amp;#039;s also a short interview with Newton, in prison. Other segments include white people at a firing rage (some of which are children), and members of the police department explaining the gear they carry in the trunks of their cars.\n\nThis film documents some of the most important and controverial black leaders of the late 60s, and is a must see for anyone interested in sixties radicalism ot the Panthers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7340405c450387c38fe1a50ec76ac2c242a747","amp;dn":"Black+Panthers+%281968%29+aka+Free+Huey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f7340405c450387c38fe1a50ec76ac2c242a747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,115,64,64,92,69,3,135,195,143,225,165,14,199,106,194,194,66,167,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
