However, the availability of nitrogen is limited in many soils and although the earth s atmosphere consists of 78.1% nitrogen gas (N2) plants are unable to use this form of nitrogen. To compensate , modern agriculture has been highly reliant on industrial nitrogen fertilizers to achieve maximum crop productivity. However, a great deal of fossil fuel is required for the production and delivery of nitrogen fertilizer. Moreover carbon dioxide (CO2) which is released during fossil fuel combustion contributes to the greenhouse effect and run off of nitrate leads to eutrophication of the waterways. \n\nBiological nitrogen fixation is an alternative to nitrogen fertilizer. It is carried out by prokaryotes using an enzyme complex called nitrogenase and results in atmospheric N2 being reduced into a form of nitrogen diazotrophic organisms and plants are able to use (ammonia). It is this process and its major players which will be discussed in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43106ca271367cd674a143e6744bb78cccf55f3d","amp;dn":"Biological+Nitrogen+Fixation+%282+Volume+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43106ca271367cd674a143e6744bb78cccf55f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,16,108,162,113,54,124,214,116,161,67,230,116,75,183,140,204,245,95,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
