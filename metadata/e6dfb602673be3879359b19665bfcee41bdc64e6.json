Lim and Hwa Sung Shin (Cambridge, 2013).pdf\n\nISBN 978-0-521-51336-4\n\nMany, if not most, industrially important fermentation and bioreactor operations are carried out in fed-batch mode, producing a wide variety of products. In spite of this, there is no single book that deals with fed-batch operations. This is the first book that puts together all the necessary background material regarding the what, why, and how of optimal and sub-optimal fed-batch operations. Numerous examples are provided to illustrate the application of optimal fed-batch cultures. This unique book, by world experts with decades of research and industrial experience, is a must for researchers and industrial practitioners of fed-batch processes (modeling, control, and optimization) in biotechnology, fermentation, food, pharmaceuticals, and waste treatment industries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6dfb602673be3879359b19665bfcee41bdc64e6","amp;dn":"Fed-Batch+Cultures+-+Principles+and+Applications+of+Semi-Batch+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6dfb602673be3879359b19665bfcee41bdc64e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,223,182,2,103,59,227,135,147,89,177,150,101,191,206,228,27,220,100,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
