His masterpiece is Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion, which won an Oscar in 1970; Buone Notizie can therefore be considered the last gasp of radical Italian cinema.\n\nThe wild plot begins with a power cut, and ends when opening a forbidden letter precipitates some unexplained crisis. We are left just as confused as the befuddled victim, which was probably the intention.\n\nAfter this, Italian cinema sank into bland feel-good stuff - I now look to South Korea and Iran to keep me awake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8abf10e54be528691d9bd3b4d21f1ac5f1b3f1e9","amp;dn":"Buone+Notizie+%28Elio+Petri%2C+1979%29+Good+News+-+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8abf10e54be528691d9bd3b4d21f1ac5f1b3f1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,191,16,229,75,229,40,105,29,155,211,180,210,31,26,197,241,179,241,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
