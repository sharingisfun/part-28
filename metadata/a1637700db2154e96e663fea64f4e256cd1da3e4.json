Like the songs that\nsinger-guitarist Matthew Caws, bassist Daniel Lorca\nand drummer Ira Elliot crafted for their previous\ntwo albums, let go (2003) and the weight is a gift\n(2005), lucky is filled with images of\nrestlessness, longing and the elusiveness of love.\nYet the band counterbalances the lyrical\nbittersweetness with a musical buoyancy. Intimate\nsongs become in-it-together anthems, thanks to the\nchiming guitars, propulsive rhythms, and the\nemotional candor in Caws&amp;#039; vocals. A song like\nbeautiful beat segues from a sparsely arranged,\nconfessional first verse into a harmony-laden\nchorus and reaches multi-layered, canon-like\nproportions before the track fades out. If Caws is\noften suggesting that romance and resolution may\nstill be an inch or two out of reach, he&amp;#039;s also\nproffering immediate musical solace. Turn up the\nvolume, hit the repeat button, and your troubles,\nfor a blissful three minutes or so, will disappear.\n\nIt has been recorded throughout March and August\n2007 at the Robert Lang Studios, in Seattle, under\nthe direction of producer John Goodmanson.\n\nThe band issued an official statement announcing\nthis album on October 12, 2007. The song &quot;See These\nBones&quot; premiered on the Anti-Hit List Podcast on\nOctober 20, 2007.[1] Due to a misquotation of\nMatthew Caws, it was first expected to be called\nTime for Plan A.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1637700db2154e96e663fea64f4e256cd1da3e4","amp;dn":"Nada+Surf+-+Lucky+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1637700db2154e96e663fea64f4e256cd1da3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,99,119,0,219,33,84,233,110,102,63,234,100,244,226,86,205,29,163,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
