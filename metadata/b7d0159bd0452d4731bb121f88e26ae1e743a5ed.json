Beginning with the fundamental principles and moving on to more advanced aspects, it combines in a single comprehensive volume the basics of warp and weft knitting, fabric structures and products, the different types of machines, principles of production and terminology to provide an invaluable reference for textiles students, textile engineers and technicians involved in knitted garment design and manufacture.\n\nFundamental rules and principles are emphasised throughout. Aspects covered include flat, circular, full fashioned, hosiery, raschel, tricot and crochet production. Development of the various types of knitting machines, their actions and mechanisms as well as the construction, properties and end uses of the products which they manufacture are also included.\n\nThe book is indexed and referenced in detail and includes numerous labelled diagrams and photographs. Terminology is defined either according to The Textile Institute's terms and definitions or current usage in the industry and is supplemented where necessary by American or continental terminology. Although SI units and the tex yarn count system are explained and used in the text, other systems have also been employed wherever it has been considered that their usage is still important. A number of worked calculations are included to clarify the examples given.\n\nKnitting technology is the ideal textbook for a range of textile courses from technician to degree level and The Textile Institute's examinations as well as being an essential companion to all those involved in the knitting industry.\n\nPublished in association with The Textile Institute\nISBN 1 85573 333 1\nISBN-13: 978 1 85573 333 6\nApril 2001\n416 pages  244 x 172mm  paperback  \nÃ‚Â£55.00 / US$95.00 / Ã¢â€šÂ¬65.00 - See more at: http://www.woodheadpublishing.com/en/book.aspx?bookID=538#sthash.OgKr9FHY.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d0159bd0452d4731bb121f88e26ae1e743a5ed","amp;dn":"Knitting+Technology+3rd+Edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d0159bd0452d4731bb121f88e26ae1e743a5ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,208,21,155,208,69,45,71,49,187,18,31,136,226,106,225,231,67,165,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
