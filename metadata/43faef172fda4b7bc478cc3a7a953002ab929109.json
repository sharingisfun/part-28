But after graduation, the only thing standing between straightedge Skylar and art school are three minimum-wage months of summer. Skylar can taste the freedom--that is, until her mother loses her job and everything starts coming apart. Torn between her dreams and the people she loves, Skylar realizes everything she's ever worked for is on the line.\n\nNineteen-year-old Josh Mitchell had a different ticket out of Creek View: the Marines. But after his leg is blown off in Afghanistan, he returns home, a shell of the cocksure boy he used to be. What brings Skylar and Josh together is working at the Paradise--a quirky motel off California's dusty Highway 99. Despite their differences, their shared isolation turns into an unexpected friendship and soon, something deeper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43faef172fda4b7bc478cc3a7a953002ab929109","amp;dn":"I%27ll+Meet+You+There+-+Heather+Demetrios","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43faef172fda4b7bc478cc3a7a953002ab929109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,250,239,23,47,218,75,123,196,120,204,58,122,149,48,2,171,146,145,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
