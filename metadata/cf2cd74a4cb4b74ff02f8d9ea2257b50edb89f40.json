Ant then jumps right into an oral sex story, we hear about the upcoming poker tournament, see a video of how Governor Christie handles a heckler, learn that Tim Cook is gay, and we watch a Dennis Miller/Norm MacDonald clip. Ant conveys his excitement for his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jaws themedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Halloween party, goes through a list of Ã¢â‚¬Å“distastefulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Halloween costumes, and the lovely callers chime in. The one and only Iron Sheik calls to discuss the roast heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hosting at Carolines on Broadway and to talk about all of the jabroniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that will be in the house, and then for the love of god (WHYYY?), Ant takes some more calls. We get a little Ã¢â‚¬Å“#TBTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ action, see a throwback clip, and the show ends by talking about an article of a woman being Ã¢â‚¬Å“cat called.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nNot a lot of time to seed. As soon as more than one person has it we will stop seeding. If that person decides not seed further no one will have it.
