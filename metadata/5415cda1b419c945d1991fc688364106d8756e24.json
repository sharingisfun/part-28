Logging? Fishing? Tourism? Ever  \nthink  to  include marijuana?  If you haven't,  \nthink again. No  longer a hobby  for the  \nstereotypical hippie  culture of  the  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s, BC's  \nillegal marijuana  trade  industry  has evolved  \ninto  a  seemingly  unstoppable  business giant, \ndubbed by  those  involved  as  'The Union'.   \nCommanding upwards of $7 billion Canadian  annually, \nThe UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s  roots  stretch  far  and wide, directly  \nand indirectly  affecting  all  areas  of  our  \nsociety. With  65%  to  85%  of  all  'BC  Bud' \nbeing exported  to  the United States,  it's clear  \nthat  the BC marijuana  trade has become an  \ninternational issue with consequences  that extend  \nfar beyond our borders.   When  there  are  record \nprofits  to be made, who  are  the players,  and \nwhen do their motives become questionable?\n\n-Why is marijuana illegal?  \n-What health risks do we really face?  \n-Does prohabition work? \n-What would happen if we taxed it?\n-Medicine, paper, fuel, textiles, food, etc. \n\nAre we missing something here?\n\nFollow  filmmaker  Adam  Scorgie  as  he  dives  \nhead  first  into  Canada's  most socially  \nacceptable  illegal  activity.  Along  the  way,  \nAdam  demsytifies  the underground  market  and  \nbrings  to  light  how  such  a  large  industry  \ncan function  while  remaining  illegal.    By  \ninterviewing  experts  from  around  the globe,  \nincluding  growers,  clippers,  police  officers,  \ncriminalogists,  economists, psychologists,  medical  \ndoctors,  politicians  and  pop  culture  icons,  \nScorgie explores the cause and effect nature of the \nbusiness behind getting high. Nobody's  innocent  in  \nthis  exploration  of  an  industry  that  may  be  \nprofiting more  by  being  illegal.  Join  Adam  \nScorgie  as  he  unravels  the mystery  of  The Union.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039647/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039647/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe basic point of this documentary is to present \nthe facts about Marijuana. It focuses less on the \nBC market and more on the reasons why marijuana \nshould be viewed in the same light as alcohol and \ntobacco. It argues for the legalization of \nmarijuana. The argument is compelling and factual \nwith many legititamate sources.\n\n==================================================\n\nFinally a NTSC DVD screener hit PirateBay, great\nquality.
