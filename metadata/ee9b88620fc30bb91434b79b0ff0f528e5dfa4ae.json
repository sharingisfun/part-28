With her immediate family unable to watch over her, it's decided that she'll spend the summer with her Uncle John (Paul Lazar). Gena takes a part-time job at a beauty parlor and makes friends with a girl named Jane (Summer Phoenix). \n\nJane, however, is not a good influence; she's a recent runaway from a halfway house and is looking for her missing brother Sonny (Sam Rockwell), a convicted felon. When Jane disappears, Gena searches for her and is led into a netherworld of drugs, crime, gang violence, and sexual initiation. This independent drama was screened at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival; Heather Matarazzo of Welcome to the Dollhouse appears in a supporting role","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9b88620fc30bb91434b79b0ff0f528e5dfa4ae","amp;dn":"Arresting+Gena+%281997%29+.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee9b88620fc30bb91434b79b0ff0f528e5dfa4ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,155,136,98,15,195,11,185,20,52,183,155,15,240,245,40,229,223,164,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
