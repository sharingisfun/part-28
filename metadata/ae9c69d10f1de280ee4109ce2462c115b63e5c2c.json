This is wrong. Correct is that we hear on track 22 take 1 with count-in of take 2.\n Also track 21 was edited. The producer of this CD inserted the coun-in of &quot;Where Did They Go Lord&quot; (take 2).\n \n\nPress info:\n\nWith great pleasure GRAVELROAD MUSIC announces the release of this excellent Show of 1971.\n Deluxe Full color Digipack with 16-page booklet includes rare photos and extensive liner notes. Also included a Special bonus gift; a reproduction of an extremely rare two sided promo card this was only available in January Ã¢â‚¬â€œ February 1971 at the International Hotel.\n The January 29, 1971 Dinner show at the International Hotel Las Vegas.\n\n It hardly needs introduction; the set list is a well-balanced mix with an impressive show!\n A strong mix of his hits and fills the show with his latest recordings and topping it of with par excellence covers of very popular recent top ten charts hits like Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have To Say You Love Me, Sweet Caroline, YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Lost That Loving Feeling, Polk Salad, Something, SnowbirdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nEven the closing of the show had a drastic change.\n Making the performances of January /February 1971 by far the most energizing starts of a Vegas Season.\n\n The extraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are a part of the Snowbird studio session with the unreleased undubbed Master take 6 &amp; a rare take of the vocal harmony overdub by Elvis.\n As extra bonus we included a seven-minute telephone conversation, privately taped in March/April 1971.\n Elvis talks about recording sessions and performing in Las Vegas, his scary International Hotel earthquake experience. (The California/Nevada area had a big earthquake in February 1971). \n\n\n \nEnjoy!\njeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae9c69d10f1de280ee4109ce2462c115b63e5c2c","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Snowbird+revisited+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae9c69d10f1de280ee4109ce2462c115b63e5c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,156,105,209,15,29,226,128,238,65,9,206,36,98,193,21,182,62,92,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
