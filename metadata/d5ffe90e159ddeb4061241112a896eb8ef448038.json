Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, using mechanics such as the original \nspin dash and power-ups including Speed Shoes, alongside the Homing Attack, seen in 3D Sonic games. Players will be able to use online leaderboards to compare level completion times and high scores. For the first time since Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic during regular levels after collecting all the Chaos Emeralds.\n Each Zone contains three acts followed by a boss battle, which are similar to boss battles from older Sonic games, but with variations added. Acts from the Zones can either be accessed in any order via a world map, or played continuously one after the other. Once all zones are cleared, players can access the final \nZone, E.G.G. Station. Special Stages, accessed by the original Sonic the Hedgehog style of finishing an act with 50 Rings and then jumping into the Giant Ring \nthat appears, are based on those of the original Sonic the Hedgehog, but also require the player to tilt the playing field in order to navigate Sonic through a maze, collecting rings to open gates.\n The game is playable in up to 1080p high definition on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and 480p on the Wii. The iOS version of the game can be controlled with either the accelerometers, or a virtual d-pad, with certain levels also utilising accelerometers. *\n\n\nEpisode 1 :\n===========\n\n Sonic is the only playable character for this Episode. If beaten with all 7 chaos emeralds a cutscene is shown which ends with a &quot;To Be Continued&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ... *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ffe90e159ddeb4061241112a896eb8ef448038","amp;dn":"PC+-+SONIC+4+WiiWare+-+32+and+64+bits+6287rev+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ffe90e159ddeb4061241112a896eb8ef448038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,255,233,14,21,157,222,180,6,18,65,17,42,137,110,184,239,68,128,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
