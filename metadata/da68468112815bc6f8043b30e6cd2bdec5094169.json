Stephen Bissette does a couple covers.)\n\nAlthough the title suggests otherwise, the story is actually science fiction, reminiscent of A Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Mackenize Queen is chosen by Ã¢â‚¬Å“the brotherhoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to save the world against the Ice Men who, having destroyed their own planet, would take Earth for themselves. Queen is assisted by an seven-foot tall alien called Ududu, who is a friendly carnivore and who also provides much of the comic relief for the story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da68468112815bc6f8043b30e6cd2bdec5094169","amp;dn":"Bernie+Mireault+-+Mackenzie+Queen+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da68468112815bc6f8043b30e6cd2bdec5094169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,104,70,129,18,129,91,198,248,4,59,48,230,205,43,222,197,9,65,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
