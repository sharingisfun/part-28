Gonsalves et al. (Wiley, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nLearn to Use Nanoscale Materials to Design Novel Biomedical Devices and Applications\r\n\r\nDiscover how to take full advantage of nanoscale materials in the design and fabrication of leading-edge biomedical devices. The authors introduce you to a variety of possible clinical applications such as drug delivery, diagnostics, and cancer therapy. In addition, the authors explore the interface between micron and nanoscale materials for the development of applications such as tissue engineering. Finally, they examine the mechanisms of cell interactions with material surfaces through the use of nanotechnology-based material processing and characterization methods.\r\n\r\nThe text's three sections highlight its interdisciplinary approach:\r\n*\r\n\r\nPart One: Nanostructure Fabrication\r\n*\r\n\r\nPart Two: Bio-Nano Interfaces\r\n*\r\n\r\nPart Three: Clinical Applications of Nanostructures\r\n\r\nAmong the key topics covered are nanotechnology in tissue regeneration; biomolecular engineering; receptor-ligand interactions; cell-biomaterial interactions; nanomaterials in diagnostics, drug delivery, and cancer therapy; and nano- and micron-level engineering and fabrication.\r\n\r\nThroughout the text, clear examples guide you through the chemistry and the processing involved in designing and developing nanoscale materials for biomedical devices. Each chapter begins with an introduction and ends with a conclusion highlighting the key points. In addition, references at the end of the chapter help you expand your research on any individual topic. In summary, this book helps biomedical researchers and engineers understand the physical phenomena that occur at the nanoscale in order to design novel cell-based constructs for a wide range of applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62bef95c0ca2bb80805f9e849dc4f3dfa86e6e7","amp;dn":"Biomedical+Nanostructures+-+K.E.+Gonsalves+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b62bef95c0ca2bb80805f9e849dc4f3dfa86e6e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,43,239,149,192,202,43,184,8,5,249,232,73,220,79,61,250,134,230,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
