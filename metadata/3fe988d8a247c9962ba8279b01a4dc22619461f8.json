Other todo applications either oversimplify or are too difficult to use. Things instead offers the perfect balance between ease of use and powerful features. \n\n&quot;Things is a true standout thanks to a great set of features and an interface that makes it a good fit for nearly any level of task management: It's simple enough to use for the most-basic to-do lists ... but it's powerful enough to handle a full blown GTD workflow... Things offers a unique combination of ease of use, a great interface, and flexibility that sets it apart from other to-do mangers I've used.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dan Frakes, Macworld, Ã¢Ëœâ€¦Ã¢Ëœâ€¦Ã¢Ëœâ€¦Ã¢Ëœâ€¦Ã‚Â½\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Winner of the Apple Design Award 2009\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Winner of the Macworld Best of Show Award 2009\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Winner of the Macworld Editor's Choice &quot;Eddy&quot; Award 2009\n\nEffortlessly manage to-dos, notes, due dates, and projects with Things' easy-to-use features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Focus on what's important: Smart task lists let you conveniently track today's work, what's next, upcoming tasks, and your ideas for the future.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Have it your way: Use Tags to assign contexts, priorities, time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whatever fits your personal workflow.
