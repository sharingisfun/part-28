It was released exclusively through iTunes Music\nStore on October 4, 2005 for two weeks, where it ranked as high as #4 on the\ntop downloaded songs list.\n\nIn an interview with saxaphone and guitarist player, Kirk Pengilly, the last\nsong in the track listing for Switch, &quot;God's Top Ten&quot; is dedicated to\nMichael Hutchence. It paints the singer as a &quot;wild colonial boy, drifting\nwith the stars&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d58e387ed914451678e11bbd43ba0a18128c7c8","amp;dn":"INXS-Switch-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d58e387ed914451678e11bbd43ba0a18128c7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,88,227,135,237,145,68,81,103,142,17,187,212,59,160,161,129,40,199,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
