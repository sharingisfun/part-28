The Sketch Book was published in installments in the United States beginning in 1819, but the section that included this story was not issued until 1820. Readers on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean thus encountered the story at approximately the same time.\n\n''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' takes place in Sleepy Hollow, New York, a snug rural valley near Tarry town in the Catskill Mountains. Constructed from German tales but set in America, it is a classic tale of the conflict between city and country, and between brains and brawn. Ichabod Crane courts Katrina Van Tassel, but is frightened away by his rival, Brom Bones, masquerading as the headless horseman. The story demonstrates the two qualities for which Irving is best known: his humor, and his ability to create vivid descriptive imagery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40627989b99e89736f5b13459aa63491260ead6a","amp;dn":"The+Legend+of+Sleepy+Hollow+by+Washington+Irving+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40627989b99e89736f5b13459aa63491260ead6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,98,121,137,185,158,137,115,111,91,19,69,154,166,52,145,38,14,173,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
