John Gribbin navigates the latest frontiers of scientific discovery to tell us what we really know about the history of the universe. Along the way, he describes how the universe began; what the early universe looked like; how its structure developed; and what emerged to hold it all together. He describes where the elements came from; how stars and galaxies formed; and the story of how life emerged. He even looks to the future: is the history of the universe going to end with a Big Crunch or a Big Rip?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e65ba572810305d6381d6025c4c845403f2c637f","amp;dn":"John+Gribbin+-+The+Universe%3A+A+Biography+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e65ba572810305d6381d6025c4c845403f2c637f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,91,165,114,129,3,5,214,56,29,96,37,196,200,69,64,63,44,99,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
