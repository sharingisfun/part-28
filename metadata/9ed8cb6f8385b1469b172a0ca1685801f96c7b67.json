There is no Regional Settings prompt during installation. Some small improvements have been made regarding registry and installer. Other than that it's exactly the same as the full Superior XP64 release from April 2009.\nThis is not &quot;warez&quot;, and no files are &quot;cracked&quot; in this OS. Original upload was done on ThePiratebay and Demonoid.\n\n\nPlease check this text prior to installing, so you know what to expect.\n\n\n-&gt; The system is set to CET and Euro usage. Only a few files for Keyboards,  internationalization and input-languages are available. See below for those that are NOT included. ***\n\n-&gt; Size did not fit on CD due to many included drivers, java, firefox and dot NET Framework (which is included for Manual installation later on)\n\n\nThis is a clean SECURE thoroughly tested A/V &amp; IT-expert's version of XP\nProfessional x64 Edition retail SP2 English (United States, NT 5.2.3790.3959).\nWith inline *corporate* Volume License Key; this release passes\n&quot;Windows Genuine Advantage&quot; checks, and a product key is NOT needed\n(see \\AMD64\\WINNT.SIF on the iso). Have your own legal key? Please\nchange it using http://magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/old.shtml\n\nWindows XP x64 supports up to 128GB of RAM !\nThis Windows version is designed to work with 64-bit processors from AMD and\nIntel that support the x64 extensions to the x86 architecture. These include\nAthlon 64, Athlon 64 FX, Mobile Athlon 64, Turion 64, Opteron processors from\nAMD, and all Xeon, Pentium 4, Dual, Quad &amp; 8 Core Intel setups with EM64T.\n\nAlthough this release is rather complete and sufficient for most users,\nthere is no Outlook Express in the core of this OS. This XP64 is intended\nfor those who - like me - prefer a Classic minimal approach, those who\nprefer OpenOffice, do audio-/video-editing, creative and developing work,\nand/or those who generally don't share their PC/laptop with other users.\nThis OS is not really for beginners. If you are one, at least make sure\nyour system is safe: https://www.xs4all.nl/en/veiligheid/checklist/\nIf you're the type that feels at home being Administrator *all the time*,\nthen this will be a Superior Windows OS for you!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBurn the .iso Image-file to DVD at 6 X speed or slower (try http://ImgBurn.com )\nDo not unpack the iso, just burn it directly, it's a boot-disc image.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nIf you want to put SXP64 on a SSD, make sure you align the partition using this:\nhttp://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showpost.php?p=326656&amp;postcount=3\n(Do this before you use the SXP64 install DVD..)\n\nPower on your PC/laptop, press the button for the system to enter BIOS.\nChange the Boot sequence to DVD first, then Save and Exit BIOS.\n'Press any key' when asked to boot with the DVD and after about 6 minutes\nyou can (Quick)format the desired storage partition you want SXP64 to be on.\n( You only need to boot from DVD once, don't press a key at the next boot ! )\n\n-&gt; Don't take out your DVD before installation is finished. Give the computer\n   sufficient time to decide what it must do, a good setup takes some time.\n\n-&gt; Don't use this DVD to  Repair  or  Upgrade  existing copies of Windows.\n\nSHA1 of LiteSXP64.iso:  f7f47339cc10840055c8e72543c4d1d366a6c905\n( you can use http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc to check this )\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIs this version of XP really &quot;Superior&quot; ?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you buy XP x64 Edition from Microsoft you'll get a rather old CD. So you\ngo to the Windows Update website and find out you need to update your system\nwith hundreds of patches, new drivers and so on. This update-process creates a\nlot of extra slack on your harddisk, backups of previous versions of numerous\nsystem-files and drivers, and roll-back options you'll never use remain there.\nSuperior XP (SXP64) already has the latest versions of system-files built-IN,\nALL official XP x64 updates released until April 23 2009 are fully integrated!\nSome parts of the original Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition were\nbound to go wrong for most users, or were never being used, so these facts have\nbeen considered creating SXP64, causing the removal of many files and updating\nof the registry. All is improved in so many ways that it warranted a freshly\ncreated install image to get better speeds and a more reliable daily workflow.\nIf your CPU and motherboard support x64 (64 bit), then this might\nvery well be the fastest Desktop/Workstation system you can find!\n\nWhat also makes this install-image superior is the fact that many storage media\ncontroller drivers are already in there. This means you can install this OS\ndirectly on new S-ATA/AHCI/RAID and SSD hardware without trouble or errors.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nADDED ITEMS &amp; FEATURES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI n t e g r a t e d  (pre-installed) into this XP64 release :\n\n- Mozilla Firefox 3.0.9, with pre-installed add-ons:\n  * ConfigMania https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4420\n  * AdBlockPlus (asks for a filter-choice at first start)\n   \n- Flash-player\n- Shockwave\n- Sun Java JRE 6u13 i586 and x64\n\n- Internet Explorer 6 (plus all security updates and settings I prefer)\n\n- Windows Media Player 11\n  plus IE6 and Firefox plugins, extra smooth/safe with tweaks.\n\n- Quicktime Lite 2.80\n\n- PSPad (4/13/2009) -&gt; Brilliant freeware Text Editor, replacing Notepad.\n                       Better than Editpad, textpad, notepad2 or notepad++\n                     ( notepad.exe is still there, under folder \\Base\\ )\n\n- Total Commander 7.04a (king of filemanagers, with 7zip and iso-mount plugins)\n\n- JKDefrag64 (replaces the Disk Defragmentation tool from MS)\n\n- ERUNT -&gt; Auto-backups state of registry, this crucial tool in essence\n  replaces System Restore, and works a LOT better! Info on using ERUNT:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/erunt.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/erunt.txt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- Autoruns (right-click My Computer) -&gt; Much better than using MSConfig\n\n- PuTTy -&gt; 64 bit SSH client, replacing telnet and hyperterminal.\n\n- DirectX 9.26.1590 (64 bit &amp; 32 bit)\n  Note that DirectX 10 for XP64 (plus a 9-10 Switcher tool)\n  can be found via the \\Superior\\ folder on your Desktop !\n\n- Some gorgeous unique Desktop Wallpapers included.\n\n- Useful extra Fonts and Cursors!\n  I really LOVE these effective and lightweight cursors. And I work with this\n  font-set because these are the ones I prefer, and I've seen too many system-\n  fonts not to know what's best for me. I also think the desktop background is\n  really cool and warm and has depth. I don't want fancy-ass useless bullshit on\n  my screen, I need my machines to work for me, deliver quality and save time,\n  not be paintings on the wall. So, if you still think I could give a rats ass\n  about your taste, please design your own OS. Let's see how awfully ugly your\n  preferences will be. I suspect they'll be heavy and non-productive, like most.\n\n- Commandline stuff available in this OS, among others:\n  arp.exe, at.exe, atsvc.exe, fc.exe, find.exe, findstr.exe, ftp.exe,\n  ipconfig.exe, logoff.exe, net.exe, nbtstat.exe, netsh.exe, netshell.exe,\n  netstat.exe, nslookup.exe, ntrights.exe, pathping.exe, ping.exe, posix.exe,\n  rcp.exe, replace.exe, secfixup.exe, subst.exe, syskey.exe, taskkill.exe,\n  tskill.exe, xcopy.exe, tracert.exe, tracert6.exe, shutdown.exe, where.exe\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nD R I V E R S\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntegrated:\n\nNVIDIA Forceware 182.50 WHQL XP 64 (all known NV GT videocards supported),\nthe latest Intel, Realtek and Broadcom ethernet drivers,\nGigabyte and many Intel chipsets/boards essentials.\n\nTEXTMODE S-ATA/AHCI/RAID drivers;\n\nNvidia SATAIDE Driver (v10.3.0.42) WHQL\nNvidia SATARAID Driver (v10.3.0.42) WHQL\nJMicron JMB36X RAID Processor (latest!)\nAll Intel(R) SATA AHCI RAID Controllers (Version 8.8.0.1009)\n\nExcept for Windows core drivers and Realtek Media,\nNO extra audio-chipset drivers are integrated !\n\nSome drivers, BUT NOT ALL, are included and compatible hardware is checked\nduring installation. Only drivers for your hardware will be installed.\n\nStill missing drivers?\n\nTry http://opendrivers.com and http://filehippo.com/ or ask the manufacturer\nof your hardware brand about XP x64 drivers. They should supply them.\nAny driver available for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition works in SXP64.\nIn most cases Windows 2003 x64 (server) software will work in SXP64 as well.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nE X C L U D E D\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    -
