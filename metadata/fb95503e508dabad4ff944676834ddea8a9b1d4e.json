The chance of returning home unscathed was one of three. \nIn short,two thirds of our army was killed or wounded, with 60,000 dead on the \nbattlefield. A generation was annihilated.   Across the country, stories of \nbravery, close calls, broken hearts and patriotism have been passed down from \ngeneration to generation.\n\nIn 2005, CBC-TV and Galafilm put out a call to descendants of Canadian First \nWorld War soldiers to participate in the living history component of the Great \nWar project. Over 6,500 Canadians applied and 150 made the final cut to take \npart in vivid battle recreations, and to experience what their ancestors went \nthrough in the killing grounds of Europe. Of the 150, 14 descendants were \nchosen for a special mission?to travel to the battlefields of England, France \nand Belgium where their ancestors fought and sometimes gave their lives.\n\nIn documentary style, THE GREAT WAR follows the 14 young men and women?\nrepresenting a cross-section of Canada?as they voyage through time to \nunderstand their ancestors? experience as soldiers and nurses at the front. \nViewers will watch as the great-grandchildren relive the horror of that time \nand how they are transformed by it.\n\nTHE GREAT WAR also dramatizes the poignant stories of the war?s greatest heroes \nfor Canada: Talbot Mercer Papineau (played by Justin Trudeau), who died a hero \nat Passchendaele, one of the deadliest battles of the war for Canada; Chaplain \nCanon Scott (played by Michael Rudder), who had to bury his own son killed in \nbattle; Ernest Lamarche (played by Maxime Cournoyer), who fought with the Van \nDoos, the only French speaking regiment in the British army.\n\nThe epic battle re-enactments of THE GREAT WAR, filmed in rural Quebec, would \nnever have happened without the participation of the 150 descendants. As with \nreal war, the young volunteers lived in an encampment and marched into the \ntrenches to fight the battles their ancestors fought. Their living history \nexperience brings to life the five major Canadian battles of the war: St. \nJulien, Beaumont-Hamel, Courcelette, Vimy and Passchaendale.\n\nTHE GREAT WAR is a new concept in historical storytelling. It weaves together \na tapestry of perspectives, and will give audiences a deeper sense of this \ndefining event in Canada?s past. \n\n\n--\n\n\n\n- thanks to festering leper at http://www.mvgroup.org\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb95503e508dabad4ff944676834ddea8a9b1d4e","amp;dn":"The+Great+War+%282007%29++-+CBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb95503e508dabad4ff944676834ddea8a9b1d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,149,80,62,80,141,171,173,79,249,68,103,104,52,221,234,138,155,29,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
