The band released four full-length studio albums and, shortly afterwards,the band split in 2008 and got back together 2014.\n\nThe band is formed a melodic death metal band Gates of Ishtar and shortly afterwards the band was created. Initially the band would be named Soulash, until changing it in 2001 to The Duskfall. Although line-up changes would hamper the band at first when band members Tommi Konu and Urban Carlsson departed, they would quickly fill the vacant slots with drummer Oskar Karlsson (from the later period of Gates of Ishtar) and bassist Kaj Molin. Soon after, the band would record and release their first demo entitled Deliverance in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Duskfall released their debut album Frailty, which was produced by Daniel Bergstrand. After the release of Frailty, Joachim LindbÃƒÂ¤ck would join the band on guitar. The final product was 2003's Source which was recorded at Daniel Bergstrand's Dug Out Studios. Duskfall would suffer more departures in the form of members Joachim LindbÃƒÂ¤ck and Kaj Molin. Eventually the band would recruit Antti Lindholm (also the vocalist and guitarist in Finnish hard rock trio Lambs) on guitars and Marco Eronen on bass. With the new additions, Duskfall would focus on recording their third studio album, Lifetime Supply of Guilt.\n\n\n\n\n\nA statement on the official website dated August 4, 2008, confirmed that the band quit following the departure of main songwriter and founder Mikael Sandorf. The band got back together 2014 according to Mikael Sandorf on Facebook and Twitter\n\nThe Duskfall is back! Their new opus which was mastered by Ahti Kortelainen (Sonata Arctica, Moonsorrow, SentencedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦) marks the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return to the scene after seven years of silence and delivers all the strengths of the Swedish metallers! Intense guitar solos, unforgettable melodies and brutal death / thrash riffing are the most obvious elements of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style. Above all soars the aggressive, yet emotional voice of Magnus that gives a very special edge to anthems like Ã¢â‚¬Å“EndgameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“FarewellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“We The FreaksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The artwork was done by Gustavo Sazes (Arch Enemy, Morbid AngelÃ¢â‚¬Â¦).\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where The Tree Stands DeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Duskfall truly embraced the essence of their sound. This IS Swedish Metal at its very best!\nThe album will be released on November 21st in Germany/Switzerland/Austria, November 24th in UK and rest of Europe and on January 13th (2015) in North America!\n\n\n\nLine-up:\nMagnus Klavborn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals (ex-Engel)\nMikael Sandorf Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars (ex-Gates of Ishtar)\nRonny Edlund Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars\nJonatan Storm Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\nFredrik Andersson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n2002     Frailty\n2003     Source\n2005     Lifetime Supply of Guilt      \n2007     The Dying Wonders of the World    \n2014     Where the Tree Stands Dead      \n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
