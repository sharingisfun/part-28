When they investigate the craft, they discover the baby Kal-El. The Kents decide to raise him as their own, naming him &quot;Clark Jerome Kent&quot;. Unlike the Silver Age continuity in the comics, Jonathan and Martha (portrayed by Eddie Jones and K Callan) are alive in the TV show, and they frequently visit Metropolis. Clark, throughout the series, proudly states that his mother (Martha, although to maintain his secret identity, he does not identify her specifically) made his Superman costume for him. Clark often consults Jonathan and Martha, either by telephone or in person after impromptu Superman flights to Smallville, about personal and moral concerns and dilemmas.\n\nTwenty-seven years later, Clark moves to Metropolis and gets a job at the Daily Planet under the gruff editor Perry White (Lane Smith). Clark also becomes acquainted with co-workers Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes in Season 1, Justin Whalin thereafter), who is a photographer, and gossip columnist Cat Grant (Tracy Scoggins). Soon after being hired, Clark is partnered with star reporter Lois Lane. (They get put on the same assignment within minutes of Clark getting a job, but they do not become formally paired on a regular basis until a few episodes in.) Although Clark falls for Lois at first sight, she considers him little more than a pest. When Superman saves her however, Lois instantly becomes infatuated with Clark's alter-ego.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e2b1e23d4bb6f36afc596b24c776f05ca6d4262","amp;dn":"Lois+and+Clark+The+New+Adventures+of+Superman+Seasons+1-4+%28Compl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e2b1e23d4bb6f36afc596b24c776f05ca6d4262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,43,30,35,212,187,111,54,175,197,150,178,76,119,111,5,202,109,66,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
