The frame story revolves around Dr. Sela Mathers, a Doctor/Professor of Literature who has been given the ability to help people by showing them fairy tales with a lesson about their life. She struggles with the fact that people ignore her advice and ruin their lives anyway, and begins using her ability to dispense justice instead (see issue #15 &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;). Sela's nemesis is Belinda, who has the same ability as Sela but uses it for evil.\nThe other portion of the story is a twisted version of a classic fairy tale. The fairy tales are often violent and end in depressing ways, warning the readers to change their lives or suffer a similar (sometimes, worse) fate.\n\n\n\nVolume #4 of ongoing series\nCollecting issues #19 - #24\npublished by Zenescope \nrecommended viewer - coview\nAll credit to original scanners and uploaders\nmore volumes to come\nenjoy!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83b3d1ee5329497921157e7f83975f816a274c2","amp;dn":"Grimm+Fairy+Tales+%7E+Volume+4%5Bflynner19%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83b3d1ee5329497921157e7f83975f816a274c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,59,61,30,229,50,148,151,146,17,87,231,248,57,117,248,22,162,116,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
