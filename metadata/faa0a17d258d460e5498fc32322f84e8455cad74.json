Along with plot synopsis, analysis, and background on the directors and actors, there are also details on censorship and the controversy sparked. The book also includes chapters on Spanish Horror under the Franco regime, the CAT III phenomenon, Mondo movies and shockumentaries, and an interview with legendary underground filmmaker Nick Zedd. Everything from big budget mainstream films to arthouse oddities and obscurities and underground flicks are covered. In this book you're just as likely to read about despised filmmakers such as Andrey Iskanov, Fred Vogel, and Uwe Boll as you are such vital artists as Abel Ferrara, David Cronenberg, and Lars Von Trier. With more than 160 films covered it's a must-read for anyone interested in the darkside of cinema. \n\nRead more at http://avaxhome.cc/ebooks/Photo_related/Be_the_D-s.html#sFgg1lDCfVQAcSYO.99","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa0a17d258d460e5498fc32322f84e8455cad74","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Darkness%3A+Cult%2C+Horror%2C+and+Extreme+Cinema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa0a17d258d460e5498fc32322f84e8455cad74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,160,161,125,37,141,70,14,84,152,252,50,50,47,132,232,69,92,173,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
