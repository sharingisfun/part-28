It was on the final weekend and I went onstage after a three-day bender, literally getting no sleep.\n\n&quot;I'd got away with it the night before but I went right through to the following day. I was up there, meandering, babbling incoherently, I ran over, terrible.\n\n&quot;After I while I slowly but surely realised how bad I was so I started heckling myself, like &quot;You fucking SUCK tonight!&quot;, tearing myself a new one. The audience just felt sorry for me, they felt awkward. People were saying &quot;Come on, get it together,&quot; then after an hour-and-a-half they started cheering me and encouraging me &quot;you can do this!&quot; It was kinda sweet, very sweet of them. But who would put the boot in when they guy's berating himself onstage.\n\n&quot;Edinburgh being Edinburgh, there was worse shit around than that, though. Hal Cruttenden told me he was behind a guy in the queue who he thought was asking for his money back, Hal started saying &quot;why are you wanting a refund that's just what Edinburgh's like, it's rock n roll&quot;, all that bullshit, and the guy said no he thought it was better than other people he'd seen.\n\n&quot;It was a mesmerising death, I've never seen anyone die like that in Edinburgh. Although I've seen previews where they've torn themselves to shreds: &quot;Why have I taken this up, this is SHIT!&quot;\n\nTrack Info:\n1 Intro\n2 Not for Melbournian Consumption\n3 Bushfires\n4 The Socio-Economic Significance of Jade Goody's Death\n5 International Homelessness\n6 British Racism and Dizzee Rascal\n7 Steve Irwin's Death\n8 Posh Aussie\n9 Latins Americans\n10 The Words P ki A o N er and a Cheese Called Coon\n11 Blunt Ambivalence Coupled With A Complete Lack Of Self-Awareness &amp; Mother The Energy Drink\n12 Lake Ballard\n13 To Death\n\nHe's hard on himself, but this CD is fucking hilarious.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f4b2308e76297b41049eb5a6602254b0b4d96a","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Brendon+Burns+-+The+Thinking+Mans+Idiot+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f4b2308e76297b41049eb5a6602254b0b4d96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,244,178,48,142,118,41,123,65,4,158,181,166,96,34,84,176,180,217,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
