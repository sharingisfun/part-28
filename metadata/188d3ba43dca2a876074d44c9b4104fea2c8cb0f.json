If there is no more inspiration, no need to add useless fillers. \nThe guitar playing is always musically and technically outstanding. John never tries to impress the audience by only playing fast by showing he's the best; The soul, tradition and technique always make one.  \nThe 4 first tracks are among the best ones here: \n&quot;I Know My Babe&quot; is a beautiful song with a memorable melody. \n&quot;Can't Keep from Crying&quot; is another good one. I can imagine this one covered by J.J. Cale it would suit him perfectly.\nAmong the instrumental stuff, just listen to &quot;Walz&quot; (which really doesn't sound like a real waltz, but who cares?). The guitar playing is impressive in the way to give such a punchy sound in the bass line while keeping the melody line clear. \nIn the gospel &quot;Nobody's Fault but Mine&quot;, last track here,  Renbourn plays the bottleneck style with a great mastery. \n\nA true masterpiece in spite of its 28' length album.\n\n\nJohn Renbourn - Another Monday\nLabel:\nTransatlantic Records\nCatalog#:\nTRA 149\nFormat:\nVinyl, LP, Album, Stereo\nCountry:\nUK\nReleased:\n1967\nGenre:\nFolk, World, &amp; Country, Rock \nStyle:\nFolk \n\nA1\t Another Monday\t1:48\nA2\t Ladye Nothing's Toye Puffe\t1:27\nA3\t I Know My Babe\t3:27\nA4\t Waltz\t1:57\nA5\t Lost Lover Blues\t1:54\nA6\t One For William\t2:48\nB1\t Buffalo\t2:31\nB2\t Sugar Babe\t4:31\nB3\t Debbie Anne\t1:37\nB4\t Can't Keep From Crying\t2:01\nB5\t Day At The Seaside\t1:11\nB6\t Nobody's Fault But Mine 1:56\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188d3ba43dca2a876074d44c9b4104fea2c8cb0f","amp;dn":"John+Redbourn...Another+Monday%281967%29cd+rip%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188d3ba43dca2a876074d44c9b4104fea2c8cb0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,141,59,164,61,202,42,135,96,116,212,76,155,65,4,254,162,200,203,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
