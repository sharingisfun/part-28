The book is pretty thick so it will be awhile for me to scan the whole thing.\n\n\nScans are 300dpi and in color. PDF format. Only the chapters have been scanned, not any pre-text garbage or table of contents, etc. It's hard scanning such a thick book once you get into the middle of it because the spine only bends so far so some words are in the &quot;gutter&quot; of the book, it is still very readable though.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e16bc16c031c5593a8f9a1e294477e0d7d6afdb","amp;dn":"Biology%3A+Life+on+Earth+%5B9th+Edition%5D+Chapters+5-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e16bc16c031c5593a8f9a1e294477e0d7d6afdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,22,188,22,192,49,197,89,58,143,154,30,41,68,119,224,215,214,175,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
