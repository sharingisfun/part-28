Years active: 2013 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Present.\nPolitical band from South Africa.\n\nCurrent members: J. Hassim Guitar / Vocals, Dirk Cornelius Smit on Drums &amp; Shakir G. Hoosen on Bass.\n\nDifferent from other bands, namely use sonic abilities to convey a message; Not happy with the way the world is and desiring to express this disapproval with the global disorder through music.\n\nThe band name Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntamericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a conjunction of the negation-prefix Ã¢â‚¬ËœantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as in Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe opposite ofÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAmerica,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the country that we most of us of the global community have identified as the bane of our very existence, i.e. the primary cause of all the woe man suffers. Make no mistake we have nothing against American culture or people, in fact most are as much victims of the oppressive system over them as the rest of the world is, especially the poor and middle classes, humanity is a brotherhood. To reiterate NOT Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anti-AmericanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but rather against all forms of harm, mistreatment, exploitation and oppression. Be they against man, flora, fauna and possibly any other creatures.\n\n\nBio :\nSo our story begins like many do, with a young man buying a guitar on a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœspur of the momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ impulse. His mother lent him some cash back on Ã¢â‚¬â„¢04 and he bought one at the closest Cash Converters. A Behringer starter-kit would you believe? So began his toil to learn the chords of an infamous newbie-tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smoke On The Water,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ initially somewhat deterred by the Ã¢â‚¬Å“what the hell is wrong with youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ response to the guitar purchase Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from closest friends and family. Feeling conflicted he did not touch the axe much for the first four months or so, then inspiration struck in a dream having received the first notes of what is now known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“SufiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a guitarist was born! Now more or less around Ã¢â‚¬â„¢05 or Ã¢â‚¬â„¢06 the opening intro of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DeceiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is composed in his mind, still being quite terrible at guitar and cause of great annoyance and irritation to those around him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ progress is slow, it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be for another five years that the song is completely composed.\n\nLooking onto Ã¢â‚¬â„¢09 when skill is honed and the desire to form a band becomes strong but still none share the values of the growing ever-more frustrated guitarist, so begins a series of unfortunate classified ads via gumtree, musolist and junkmail which yield no winners but ample messages of support. Never the less the years creep on right into 2011. At this time several songs are written and the process of recording the material begins. From there artwork is introduced in-line with the political intent of the future group.\n\nMeanwhile in Ã¢â‚¬â„¢09 Dirk started out learning guitar and eventually moved on to Drums, he then joined a South African grunge band called Ã¢â‚¬ËœSharpeville MassacreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and was with them till they disbanded in circa November 2011. He then went through a difficult point even having to sell his drumset to pay the billsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Ã¢â‚¬Â¦In 2013, quite unexpectedly someone answers the call, a drummer, in Pretoria! Can this be? It is!\n\nIndeed this is where another member of our band makes his entry into our tale, within roughly the same period an old school friend is visiting and decides this is what we Ã¢â‚¬ËœneedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to be doing! Shaakir, a brash lower-middle class Muslim boy, from a particularly rough neighbourhood called Eersterus, not expected to listen to A-Ha, Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. Alas, he liked what the masses did not, refusing to take to the mould of his ilk. Fast-forward to a budding bassist, in a unique band, ready to rock your mind.\n\nThus Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntamericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ came to be. No one was ever that fond of the name but it is what it is and so they are.\n\n\nEP Release Info:\nMusic is an art form, the notion of selling it like a commodity or attaching a Ã¢â‚¬ËœvalueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as the norm to us as musicians is inconceivable, it cheapens any creation. It took our souls, blood and sweat to produce it, seeing that we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t attach Ã¢â‚¬Ëœenough valueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to that, we rather release it to our fellows in humanity so they can establish what it means to them! In The Land Of The Blind is Antamerica's debut EP/ Album, consisting a variety of genres: Acoustic, Instrumental, Metal, Electronic &amp; Rock.\n\nThat being said, Feel free to contact us if you ever wish to donate, Bitcoin address: 1CNKwM5Dc88nhK1fgsH2pbH7xKUR9mPy9FÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Ã¢â‚¬Â¦at least we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold you at gun-point!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13542bf5490a8ea619b19a706bc12a9a12b8572","amp;dn":"Antamerica+-+In+The+Land+Of+The+Blind+%5BEP%5D+%28Political%29+320kBit%2F4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13542bf5490a8ea619b19a706bc12a9a12b8572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,53,66,191,84,144,168,234,97,155,25,167,6,188,18,169,161,43,133,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
