We learn that customers are now in charge, people anywhere can find each other and join forces to support a companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s efforts or oppose them, life and business are more public, conversation has replaced marketing, and openness is the key to success. JarvisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ other laws include being a platform (help users create products, businesses, communities, and networks of their own); hand over control to anyone; middlemen are doomed; and your worst customer is your best friend, and your best customer is your partner. \n\nJarvis offers thought-provoking observations and valuable examples for individuals and businesses seeking to fully participate in our Internet culture and maximize the opportunities it offers. It is unclear what role Google played, if any, in the preparation of this book, which provides excellent advertising for the company.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256284e7d55016621d4c84d375a989becdfc3f2d","amp;dn":"What+Would+Google+Do+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256284e7d55016621d4c84d375a989becdfc3f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,98,132,231,213,80,22,98,29,76,132,211,117,169,137,190,205,252,63,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
